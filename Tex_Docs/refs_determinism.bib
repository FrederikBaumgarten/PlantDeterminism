  abstract = {Globally, root production accounts for 33--67\% of terrestrial net primary productivity and influences decomposition via root production and turnover, carbon (C) allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and root exudation. As recognized above ground, the timing of phenological events affects terrestrial C balance, yet there is no parallel understanding for below-ground phenology. In this paper we examine the phenology of root production and its relationship to temperature, soil moisture, and above-ground phenology. Synthesizing 87 observations of whole-plant phenology from 40 studies, we found that, on average, root growth occurs 25 {\textpm} 8 d after shoot growth but that the offset between the peak in root and shoot growth varies {$>$} 200 d across biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical). Root and shoot growth are positively correlated with median monthly temperature and mean monthly precipitation in boreal, temperate, and subtropical biomes. However, a temperature hysteresis in these biomes leads to the hypothesis that internal controls over C allocation to roots are an equally, if not more, important driver of phenology. The specific mechanisms are as yet unclear but they are likely mediated by some combination of photoassimilate supply, hormonal signaling, and growth form.},

  abstract = {Canopy phenology is a widely used proxy for deciduous forest growth with various applications in terrestrial ecosystem modeling. Its use relies on common assumptions that canopy greening and stem growth are tightly coordinated processes, enabling predictions on the timing and the quantity of annual tree growth. Here, we present parallel observations of canopy and stem growth phenology and annual stem increment in around 90 deciduous forest trees with diffuse-porous (Fagus sylvatica, Acer pseudoplatanus, Carpinus betulus) or ring-porous (Quercus robur {\texttimes} petraea) wood anatomy. These data were collected in a mixed temperate forest at the Swiss-Canopy-Crane II site, in 4~years with strongly contrasting weather conditions. We found that stem growth resumption lagged several weeks behind spring canopy greening in diffuse-porous but not in ring-porous trees. Canopy greening and stem growth resumption showed no or only weak signs of temporal coordination across the observation years. Within the assessed species, the seasonal timing of stem growth varied strongly among individuals, as trees with high annual increments resumed growth earlier and also completed their main growth earlier. The length of main growth activity had no influence on annual increments. Our findings not only challenge tight temporal coordination of canopy and stem growth phenology but also demonstrate that longer main growth activity does not translate into higher annual increments. This may compromise approaches modeling tree growth and forest productivity with canopy phenology and growth length.},

  abstract = {Phenological shifts in response to changing climatic conditions is a key acclimation process for the persistence of perennial plants in temperate and boreal climates. The optimal time to leaf-out is the result of an evolutionary process determined by the trade-off between minimizing the risk of freezing damages and herbivory pressure while maximizing resource uptake to increase competitiveness against the other plants. We quantified the penalty exerted by frost damage at the time of leaf emergence on plant development (reduction in leaf area, canopy duration and growth) over the potential gains without frost (increased biomass and non-structural carbohydrate reserves), depending on when leaf-out occurs. To this purpose, we exposed 960 saplings of four temperate deciduous tree species with contrasting cold hardiness to two frost intensities shortly after leaf emergence, which was artificially induced at four occasions to reflect the whole range of natural leaf-out dates. One year above-ground biomass (AGB) increments following the frost revealed a clear ranking among the species depending on their strategy to cope with damaging frosts. Prunus avium (-41\% of AGB-increment compared to control saplings) resprouted from the stem base, Quercus robur (-62\%) rapidly produced new leaves from dormant reserve buds, Fagus sylvatica (-98\%) showed highest chlorophyll content in autumn and delayed senescence together with Carpinus betulus (-105\%), which overcompensated NSC reserves after the growing season but showed highest mortality (up to 32\%). In all species, NSC reserves recovered rapidly to control levels at the expense of growth. The timing of leaf-out (advanced and delayed artificially) significantly affected the performance and recovery (regreening and growth) of both frozen and non-frozen saplings, with the lowest performance found at the most delayed leaf-out date. We propose that the potential to recover from frost damages is an important component of a tree's performance, particularly at the juvenile stage. The ability to recover may become even more decisive in the future with the predicted increase of false springs in many extratropical regions.

In the early successional species the architectural development pattern and growth design are geared to maximize production under high light environments. These trees have an indeterminate pattern of shoot growth, a prolonged growth period with greater extension growth and rhythmicity (except for A. nepalensis with continuous growth) and branch mainly by syllepsis. These species emphasize vertical growth at the expense of lateral spread. In contrast, the late successional species make modest growth under a determinate scheme, the growth being confined to preformed bud primordia for a brief period of the growing season. There is less rhythmicity in growth and branch productin is by prolepsis. These species emphasize lateral spread, as an adaptation to highly competitive environments. In forest situations these species have one determinate flush of shoot growth only but in open situations there were two such flushes. Bifurcation ratio values are found to vary in forest and open situations, suggesting the capacity of the species to adjust their architecture to changed light conditions.},

Observed growth patterns agree well with those predicted by a model of rhythmic growth which assumes the dependence of shoot growth on the functional equilibrium between shoot and root system.

A model for the simulation of rhythmic growth was developed based on the assumption that endogenous rhythms can result from feedback interaction between two potentially continuous processes, like shoot and root growth, if the slower process is rate limiting for the faster one. Rhythmic growth in trees would be the consequence of feedback mechanisms needed for maintaining a constant shoot: root ratio. Period length of the rhythms depends upon the rates of the growth processes involved. Environmental factors modify period length through affecting growth rates. Growth patterns predicted by the model compare well with growth measurements of tropical trees. The transition from intermittent to continuous growth, as observed under certain conditions, can be simulated by varying a single parameter in the model.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}New insights into the intra-annual dynamics of tree-ring formation can improve our understanding of tree-growth response to environmental conditions at high-resolution time scales. Obtaining this information requires, however, a weekly monitoring of wood formation, sampling that is extremely time-intensive and scarcely feasible over vast areas. Estimating the timing of cambial and xylem differentiation by modeling thus represents an interesting alternative for obtaining this important information by other means. Temporal dynamics of cambial divisions can be extracted from the daily tree-ring growth rate computed by the Vaganov--Shashkin (VS) simulation model, assuming that cell production is tightly linked to tree-ring growth. Nonetheless, these predictions have yet to be compared with direct observations of wood development, i.e., {$<$}italic{$>$}via{$<$}/italic{$>$} microcoring, over a long time span. We tested the performance of the VS model by comparing the observed and predicted timing of wood formation in black spruce [{$<$}italic{$>$}Picea mariana{$<$}/italic{$>$} (Mill.)]. We obtained microcores over 15 years at 5 sites along a latitudinal gradient in Quebec (Canada). The measured variables included cell size and the timing of cell production and differentiation. We calibrated the VS model using daily temperature and precipitation recorded by weather stations located on each site. The predicted and observed timing of cambial and enlarging cells were highly correlated ({$<$}italic{$>$}R{$<$}/italic{$>$}\textsuperscript{2} = 0.8); nonetheless, we detected a systematic overestimation in the predicted timing of cambial cells, with predictions delayed by 1--20 days compared with observations. The growth rate of cell diameter was correlated with the predicted growth rate assigned to each cambial cell, confirming that cell diameter developmental dynamics have the potential to be inferred by the tree-ring growth curve of the VS model. Model performances decrease substantially in estimating the end of wood formation. The systematic errors suggest that the actual relationships implemented in the model are unable to explain the phenological events in autumn. The mismatch between the observed and predicted timing of wood formation in black spruce within our study area can be reduced by better adapting the VS model to wet sites, a context for which this model has been rarely used.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Our structural equation model explained 80\% of micro-density variation within the tree-ring with direct effects of wall thickness ({$\sigma$} = 0.61), cell diameter ({$\sigma$} = -0.51), and photoperiod ({$\sigma$} = -0.26). Wood formation dynamics had an indirect effect on micro-density. Micro-density increased under longer periods of cell-wall deposition and shorter durations of enlargement. Our results fill a critical gap in understanding the relationships underlying micro-density variation in conifers.

These patterns allow for the development of tissues during the short time window available for growth in cold climates. Primary and secondary growth, two expensive processes for plants, are supposedly modulated in time to optimize allocation of carbon to bud and woody tissues. We aimed to assess the phenology of primary and secondary meristems, testing their relationship over the closed black spruce stands of the commercially exploited forest region in Quebec, Canada. Location Quebec, Canada. Time period 2002--2016. Major taxa studied Gymnospermae. Methods We combined weekly scaled field observations with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to extract timings of photosynthesis and meristem growth in five black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] stands located along a latitudinal gradient and to assess their relationship. We then tested empirical models based on geographical position and seasonal temperatures to predict wood phenology (i.e., the onset and ending of earlywood and latewood formation), and compared its spatial patterns with existing predictions of bud phenology for the same study area. Results Photosynthesis started at the beginning of May, 3 weeks before bud reactivation and the onset of wood growth. Latewood formation started in mid-July, after shoot elongation was completed. For wood phenology models, the residual standard error ranged from 1 week to 12 days. Growth dynamics spatialized across the boreal forest of Quebec varied with the transition between the subarctic and humid continental climate. Main conclusions Shoot elongation and latewood formation were temporally separated, providing evidence of a trade-off in structural carbon allocation between primary and secondary growth in trees. Spatial patterns of wood phenology predicted for the black spruce polygons are consistent with spatial patterns of bud phenology, demonstrating synchronized temporal dynamics of meristems at the regional scale.},

Regeneration of the nine genotypes that were not recalcitrant was enhanced over the one year period by repeated stock plant hedging.

Beginning with a limited number of undifferentiated cells, the final size of an organ is attained by a complex interplay of cell proliferation and subsequent cell expansion. Regulatory mechanisms that integrate intrinsic growth signals and environmental cues are required to enable optimal leaf and flower development. This review focuses on plant-specific principles of growth reaching from the cellular to the organ level. The currently known genetic pathways underlying these principles are summarized and network connections are highlighted.

Current life-history theory does not offer a consistent view on the origin of this diversity. We use dynamic optimization to examine resource allocation in seasonal environments, considering that offspring produced at different times of the season have unequal future prospects. Reduction of these prospects during the season produced indeterminate growers that grew mostly after maturation, achieving large final body sizes. It also changed the optimal timing of growth and reproduction during a season, from grow-first-reproduce-later, as usually predicted by life-history theory, to the reproduce-first-grow-later tactic; other tactics were produced by the interactive effects of winter survival and unequal offspring prospects. The results suggest that devaluation of offspring production provides conditions for the evolution of capital breeding, even in fully predictable seasonal environments. Thus, the unequal fate of newborns from different parts of a season may explain the origin of diversity of reproductive phenologies, growth patterns, and capital breeding in nature.},

Yet, their applicability to extremely slow-growing trees, such as those in peatlands, has been limited due to the intricate and slow nature of growth, therefore rendering interpretation of results complex. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive monitoring of tree wood formation in both peatland and mineral soil ecosystems in southern Sweden (58.37\,N, 12.17 E, 75\,m asl) in 2021 and 2022, using both band and point dendrometers. To verify and validate the dendrometer data, we also sampled microcores every two weeks during both growing seasons. We find that peatland trees grow at approximately 30 \% the rate of their neighbors on mineral soils. The onset of growth among peatland trees typically occurs between mid-May and early June, consistently lagging the start of the growing season in trees on mineral soils by one to three weeks. Notably, growth peaks are synchronized across peatland trees and coincide with the summer solstice. Both types of dendrometers exhibit varying degrees of accuracy depending on the phenological stages measured. They perform well in identifying growth onset and peak but are less effective at detecting growth cessation. Point dendrometers demonstrate superior accuracy as they better capture daily irreversible growth increments. In the case of band dendrometers, growth increments are obscured by greater reversible fluctuations in dead bark tissues. However, they remain valuable for tracking the wood phenology of trees with growth rates exceeding 2\,mm/year. Based on our results, for an effective tree monitoring in peatlands, we strongly recommend (1) using point dendrometers and (2) removing the dead bark tissues on monitored trees.},

Polycyclism frequency is likely to change with the anticipated climate trend, expected to impact plant growth over the next century. However, polycyclism processes are not well described in the literature, and an important lack of knowledge prevents any possible prediction for the twenty-first century. Aleppo pine is a good model to study polycyclism: it is known to produce up to four annual flushes in one growing season. In this study, we used architectural analysis to describe and reconstruct polycyclism processes, periodicity and frequency on Aleppo pine in a Mediterranean site for the last 15~years. We also assessed relationships between polycyclism frequency and climate. Since 1995, climate was far hotter and drier than normal in South-eastern France: polycyclism was significantly reduced, particularly after 2003 heat-wave, which delayed effect remains till 2008, exacerbated by repeated droughts. Morphologically, polycyclism is primarily influenced by twig vigour, status (principal/secondary and strong axes) and position (low, middle or top crown). Climatically, it depends on summer temperatures of the current and preceding year, rainfall of the first half of preceding year and winter rainfall. Previous year abundant rainfall combined with colder temperatures and high rainfall in spring or at the end of summer of the current year increase tricyclism frequency. Polycyclism is likely to decrease significantly in the twenty-first century due to a hotter and drier climate.},

Given the central role of trees in mitigating and responding to climate change, it is surprising that there are still fundamental features of how trees grow, adjust their development and physiology for environmental conditions, and transport water through their woody bodies that remain poorly understood. The new paper by Valdovinos-Ayala et al. (2022) in this issue provides new insights into the seasonal cycles of perennial growth in angiosperm trees, and how this is related to the development and function of water-conducting tissues. Along the way, this work also presents new questions and exposes basic knowledge gaps regarding the annual growth cycles of trees and their ability to transport water and mitigate variations in the environment.},

A number of studies have focused on the variability of different characteristics of these extremes, including their frequency, spatial extent, and severity. Recently, the study of compound extremes, defined by the co-occurrence of multiple events with extreme impacts, has attracted much attention. The compound dry and hot extreme is one type of compound extreme and may lead to detrimental impacts on the society and ecosystem. Most previous studies have focused on changes in the frequency or spatial extent of compound dry and hot extremes, while assessments of changes in the severity of compound extremes are lacking. This study evaluated changes in the severity of compound dry and hot extremes at the global scale, based on the Standardized Dry and Hot Index (SDHI). A significant increase in the severity of compound dry and hot extremes (or decrease of the SDHI value) during the warm season was found in western US, northern South America, western Europe, Africa, western Asia, southeastern Asia, southern India, northeastern China and eastern Australia. Moreover, a significant temporal increase in the average severity of the hottest month over global land areas was also observed. Results from this study highlight the increased severity of compound dry and hot extremes over global land areas and call for improved efforts on assessing the impact of compound extremes under global warming.},

However, in some plants, the commitment to continued flower production is evidently caused by a plant's commitment to perpetually produce floral stimulus in the leaves. Ultimately, the induction of flowering leads to the specification of flowers at the shoot apex.

Comparison of measured features (length, number of axillary products, reproductive organs) at common ages from the three stands supported the validity of using these data to form a continuous chronosequence.

Two main phases of development corresponding respectively to the juvenile vegetative and adult reproductive stages were identified, and the transition between both occurred in 9-yr-old trees.

We show that in perennial Arabis alpina, flowering in response to winter cold depends on the floral integrator SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15 (SPL15), whose activity is limited to older shoots and branches during cold exposure. In annuals, this regulatory system is conserved, but cold-induced flowering occurs in young shoots, without requirement for SPL15, through the photoperiodic pathway when plants return to warm. By reconstructing the annual response in perennials, we conclude that characteristic patterns of reproduction in annuals and perennials are conferred through variation in dependency on distinct flowering pathways acting in parallel.},

  abstract = {The optimal growth schedule of a deciduous perennial plant is studied theoretically. We make three basic assumptions. First, the daily net photosynthetic rate of a plant increases but saturates with the size of the production part (vegetative organs working for photosynthesis). Second, the production part is discarded at the end of a growing season, but it may be rebuilt at the beginning of the next season using stored material. And finally, the plant maximizes the lifetime reproductive investment by choosing both the growth schedule within each season and the resource allocation between reproduction for the year and storage for the next season. The model is analyzed by the combination of maximum principle and dynamic programming. Our analysis showed three basic results. First, the annual life cycle is optimal under low storage efficiency, low habitat reliability, low growth rate, and a short growing season. Second, under any other conditions, perennial growth is optimal. During years in which the final amount of resources is smaller than a critical value S*, the plant remains immature and saves all of the resources for the next season. If it becomes larger than S*, the plant invests the excess in reproductive activities and repeats the same growth schedule thereafter (steady state). Finally, reproductive effort (the ratio of reproductive investment to total annual production) of a mature plant is high for an annual, is lowest for a perennial just above the threshold for the perennial growth pattern, increases as the length of the season increases, and in a very productive habitat may even exceed the level for an annual. The ratio of the plant size established by stored material to the maximum plant size decreases with the length of the growing season, which quantitatively fits the available data. In light of the model, reported growth patterns and leaf phenology of many deciduous plants indicate that the nonlinearity of photosynthetic rate as a function of the size of the production part is important. For a case with nonlinear photosynthesis but without an upper limit to the leaf expansion rate, a plant's optimal phenology, if normalized by size, can be parameterized by two quantities: productivity (maximum relative growth rate multiplied by a season's length) and stability (annual survival multiplied by storage efficiency). The timing of the cessation of leaf production within a season by a small immature plant is determined by productivity (occurring later in a more productive habitat). Leaf production ends earlier in the season as the plant grows. The optimal time for ending leaf production in a mature plant, in contrast, is controlled mainly by stability (it ceases earlier at a more stable site) and is almost independent of productivity.},

  abstract = {Seasonal changes in mean numbers of leaves per shoot were shown for 41 tall-tree species in deciduous broad-leaved forests in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Three types of leaf-emergence pattern were recognized; namely (1) succeeding type, (2) intermediate type, and (3) flush type. The two species showing the succeeding type emergence pattern have homonomous winter buds characterized by one-lamina and two-stipules sets. The species of intermediate- or flush-type emergence pattern usually have heteronomous winter buds with several bud scales. A negative correlation was found between leaf-emergence duration and number of bud scales. Species having a long leaf-emergence duration were open land or gap invaders. Among them, those having long leaf-fall duration were found in riverside forests. On the other hand, species showing flush-type leaf emergence with short duration and almost simultaneous leaf fall with also short duration were mainly found in mixed-forest stands. The longevities of leaves at the basal part of the shoot were short in the species whose bud scales have not entirely differentiated from foliage leaves. The main evolutionary trend in the shoots was suggested to be from homonomous to heteronomous structure and towards the clear distinction between foliage leaves and bud scales.},

The height to which trees can grow and the biophysical determinants of maximum height are poorly understood. Some models predict heights of up to 120\,m in the absence of mechanical damage3,4, but there are historical accounts of taller trees5. Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis6. We studied redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), including the tallest known tree on Earth (112.7\,m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a maximum tree height of 122--130\,m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Background: Undisturbed high elevation treelines follow a common growing season isotherm, irrespective of latitude. Small stature plants thrive at much higher elevations because they grow in a favourable microclimate near the ground, whereas trees are aerodynamically coupled to free atmospheric circulation, hence the uniform treeline elevation in a given region. Aims: I argue that the treeline results from tree architecture and not from a tree-specific inferior physiology. At tissue level, all cold adapted higher plants (including winter crops) face similar temperature related limitations and are constrained by similar thermal thresholds. Methods: In order to explore this hypothesis, winter rape and winter oat were grown in the field and the daily rate of leaf expansion was measured during early winter, with temperatures similar to those at treeline at the beginning of the growing season (monthly mean temperature of 5 {$^\circ$}C). Results: Leaves of these winter crops only grew when the degree hours above 5 {$^\circ$}C for a given day exceeded zero. Rape and oats showed very similar responses. The data support a common temperature threshold for tissue formation in winter crops and treeline trees. Conclusions: A literature survey revealed lower temperature thresholds (close to freezing point) in arctic and Antarctic algae. It appears that the formation of complex, partly lignified tissue does not happen below 5 {$^\circ$}C, whereas such temperatures exert little constraints on photosynthesis. The study illustrates that tissue growth in winter crops can help understand growth of treeline trees, given that both exhibit similar minimum temperature requirements for meristem functioning.}

This complexity was discussed by Romberger (55) nearly 25 years ago. Yet his analysis of the unresolved challenges in dormancy research is still valid today, for the overall understanding of dormancy is limited. This lack of understanding may be due, in part, to the abundance of terminology that has arisen without a nomenclatural framework in which to classify and relate the events being described.},

Physiological experiments have been performed with diverse species, whereas studies mostly on Arabidopsis thaliana, a little flowering plant, have led to the development of current genetic models. This review will focus on the four-floral inductive pathways which operate in Arabidopsis: Photoperiodic, autonomous, gibberellin promotion, and vernalization pathways and how in this network of pathways, different nodes signify a site of signal integration and how the pathways are integrated, leading to a co-ordinated initiation of flowering.},

However, a higher number of developing tracheids could prolong cell differentiation and, consequently, lengthen the growing season. The relationship between the amount and duration of cell production in the xylem remains an unresolved issue. The aim of this study was to resolve the chicken-or-egg causality dilemma about duration of growth and cell production through simple- and double-cause models. This was achieved by (1) analysing the intra-annual growth dynamics of the xylem in Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP during 2006--2009 in two contrasting sites of the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada, and (2) extracting the dates of onset and ending of xylem formation and the number of radial cells along the tree ring. A higher number of cells was linked to an earlier onset (r = 0.74) and later ending (r = 0.61) of cell differentiation. The absence of a relationship between the residuals of the onset and ending of xylogenesis (rp = -0.06) indicated that cell production influenced the correlation between the two phenophases of the xylem. These results demonstrated that a higher number of cells produced delay the ending of xylem maturation, so extending the duration of wood formation.},

This makes retrospective analyses and modeling of future tree performance difficult. This research investigates the presence, the distinctness, and the periodicity of growth ring for dominant tree species in two semi-deciduous rainforests, which contrast in terms of precipitation dynamics. Eighteen tree species common to both forests were investigated. We used the cambial marking technique and then verified the presence and periodicity of growth-ring boundaries in the wood produced between pinning and collection by microscopic and macroscopic observation. The study showed that all eighteen species can form visible growth rings in both sites. However, the periodicity of ring formation varied significantly within and between species, and within sites. Trees from the site with clearly defined dry season had a higher likelihood to form periodical growth rings compared to those from the site where rainfall seasonality is less pronounced. The distinctness of the formed rings however did not show a site dependency. Periodical growth-ring formation was more likely in fast-growing trees. Furthermore, improvements can be made by a detailed study of the cambial activity through microcores taken at high temporal resolution, to get insight on the phenology of the lateral meristem.},

We examined fine root and shoot phenology of 42 seedlings representing a variety of woody species that inhabit the cool temperate forests of northern Japan. Some aspects of phenology were common to the pool of species examined: we found positive relationships between root and shoot phenology for the end of growth, and for the duration of growth, but not for the start of growth. Further, seedlings that started root growth relatively early also ended root growth relatively late. Other aspects of phenology varied predictably with functional traits, i.e. leaf habit and successional status: first, root growth in evergreen species started significantly earlier and ended later than in deciduous species; second, early successional species had the longest duration of shoot growth among all successional types. Our results suggest that niche differentiation may be promoted by differences in phenology between root and shoots, likely contributing to the co-existence of woody seedlings in temperate forests.},

The mechanism involves epigenetic activation of the CcMADS19 locus (FLC orthologue), encoding a floral repressor. To understand how this epigenetic regulation is reverted to allow flowering in the following season, we have forced precocious sprouting of axillary buds in fruit-bearing shoots, and examined the competence to floral inductive signals of old and new leaves derived from them. We have found that CcMADS19 is enriched in repressive H3K27me3 marks in young, but not old leaves, revealing that axillary buds retain a silenced version of the floral repressor that is mitotically transmitted to the newly emerging leaves, which are able to induce flowering. Therefore, we propose that flowering in Citrus is necessarily preceded by vegetative sprouting, so that the competence to respond to floral inductive signals is reset in the new leaves.},

Additional summer months did not extend the growing period, as canopy browning started 34--41 days after the start of the season, even when GSL was more than doubled. Less than 10\% of roots were produced during the added months, suggesting that root growth was as conservative as leaf growth. Few species showed a weak second greening under prolonged GSL, but not the dominant sedge. A longer growing season under future climate may therefore not extend growth in this widespread alpine community, but will foster species that follow a less strict phenology.},

Global patterns of high-temperature tolerance are documented in animals, but generally not in plants, limiting our ability to assess risks associated with climate warming. To assess whether there are global patterns in high-temperature tolerance of leaf metabolism, we quantified Tcrit (high temperature where minimal chlorophyll a fluorescence rises rapidly and thus photosystem II is disrupted) and Tmax (temperature where leaf respiration in darkness is maximal, beyond which respiratory function rapidly declines) in upper canopy leaves of 218 plant species spanning seven biomes. Mean site-based Tcrit values ranged from 41.5 {$^\circ$}C in the Alaskan arctic to 50.8 {$^\circ$}C in lowland tropical rainforests of Peruvian Amazon. For Tmax, the equivalent values were 51.0 and 60.6 {$^\circ$}C in the Arctic and Amazon, respectively. Tcrit and Tmax followed similar biogeographic patterns, increasing linearly ({\texttildelow}8 {$^\circ$}C) from polar to equatorial regions. Such increases in high-temperature tolerance are much less than expected based on the 20 {$^\circ$}C span in high-temperature extremes across the globe. Moreover, with only modest high-temperature tolerance despite high summer temperature extremes, species in mid-latitude ( 20--50{$^\circ$}) regions have the narrowest thermal safety margins in upper canopy leaves; these regions are at the greatest risk of damage due to extreme heat-wave events, especially under conditions when leaf temperatures are further elevated by a lack of transpirational cooling. Using predicted heat-wave events for 2050 and accounting for possible thermal acclimation of Tcrit and Tmax, we also found that these safety margins could shrink in a warmer world, as rising temperatures are likely to exceed thermal tolerance limits. Thus, increasing numbers of species in many biomes may be at risk as heat-wave events become more severe with climate change.},

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Fagus sylvatica (Beech) is a large usually single-stemmed deciduous tree native to south-east England but now growing over almost the whole of the British Isles, often planted as a forestry tree on all but the wettest soils. It forms extensive woodlands, where it is dominant over a large altitudinal range, competing primarily with Quercus robur. The outcome of this competition is determined by local soil and climatic conditions leading to a gradation into oak woodlands. It is monoecious, wind-pollinated and notable for its periodic large seed numbers (mast years); seed is dispersed by birds and mammals but mostly drops below the parent tree. Fagus sylvatica is hardy, very shade tolerant, casts a deep shade and is fairly resistant to browsing but susceptible to spring frosts. Due to its shallow rooting and intensive rather than extensive mode of soil water exploitation, it is also susceptible to drought, and this is likely to be the main factor controlling its expected response to climate change. Fagus sylvatica is facing few conservation problems, and indeed, its range is currently expanding into central Europe. However, in the face of climate change, its range is likely to contract from its extremes in all but the north, and Phytophthora diseases may become more serious.},

  abstract = {The development of the trunk and main branches of approximately 26-year-old Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp. et Endl.) Krasser trees was studied. The length and number of leaves of annual shoots were recorded for 56 trees from a natural population. Morphological and macroanatomical features allowed the identification of shoot apex deaths and the axillary positions from which branches and relay shoots derived. The trees had a mean height of approximately 6 m and a mean basal diameter of approximately 8 cm. The length of trunk shoots increased from the first years to the intermediate years of tree growth and decreased for the last 6 years of tree growth. The maximum length and number of leaves of trunk shoots were registered for the years around 1985, when tree age was about 17 years. The likelihood of apex death for trunk shoots was minimum for the period of maximum trunk shoot size. Despite the fact that the architectural features of the sampled trees corresponded to those of young, vigorously growing trees, they seemed to have reached a stage of low annual height growth. A sharp decrease in trunk shoot size occurred in 1992, a year in which rainfall during the growing season reached the minimum for the lifetime of the sampled trees. The size of shoots developed after 1992 was, on average, lower than that of shoots developed before 1992. Stressful conditions in this year may relate to meristem ageing and thus to the size of shoots formed in the following years. Main branches started their development with shoots similar to those of the trunk but were clearly differentiated from the trunk 5 years later. The differentiation between main branch and trunk shoots involved not only a lower shoot size but also a higher number of leaves per shoot length unit in main branch than in trunk shoots.Key words: Nothofagus pumilio, architectural analysis, shoot, trunk development, branching pattern, morphogenetic gradient.},

Transitions between phases appear to be initiated by factors extrinsic to the shoot apical meristem; the ability of the shoot to respond to such factors and to remain in a particular phase of development is regulated by factors intrinsic to the meristem. The possibility that developmental phases are maintained by epigenetic cell states and the role of DNA methylation in this process are discussed.},

  abstract = {Plant phenology is one of the strongest indicators of ecological responses to climate change, and altered phenology can have pronounced effects on net primary production, species composition in local communities, greenhouse gas fluxes, and ecosystem processes. Although many studies have shown that aboveground plant phenology advances with warmer temperatures, demonstration of a comparable association for belowground phenology has been lacking because the factors that influence root phenology are poorly understood. Because roots can constitute a large fraction of plant biomass, and root phenology may not respond to warming in the same way as shoots, this represents an important knowledge gap in our understanding of how climate change will influence phenology and plant performance. We review studies of root phenology and provide suggestions to direct future research. Only 29\% of examined studies approached root phenology quantitatively, strongly limiting interpretation of results across studies. Therefore, we suggest that researchers emphasize quantitative analyses in future phenological studies. We suggest that root initiation, peak growth, and root cessation may be under different controls. Root initiation and cessation may be more constrained by soil temperature and the timing of carbon availability, whereas the timing of peak root growth may represent trade-offs among competing plant sinks. Roots probably do not experience winter dormancy in the same way as shoots: 89\% of the studies that examined winter phenology found evidence of growth during winter months. More research is needed to observe root phenology, and future studies should be careful to capture winter and early season phenology. This should be done quantitatively, with direct observations of root growth utilizing rhizotrons or minirhizotrons.},

Location Ten European and Canadian sites at different latitudes and altitudes. Methods The periods of cambial activity and cell differentiation were assessed on a weekly time-scale on histological sections of cambium and wood tissue collected over 2 to 5 years per site from 1998 to 2005 from the stems of seven conifer species. All data were compared with daily air temperatures recorded from weather stations located close to the sites. Logistic regressions were used to calculate the probability of xylogenesis and of cambium being active at a given temperature. Results Xylogenesis lasted from May to October, with a growing period varying from 3 to 5 months depending on location and elevation. Despite the wide geographical range of the monitored sites, temperatures for onset and ending of xylogenesis converged towards narrow ranges with average values around 4-5, 8-9 and 13-14 degrees C for daily minimum, mean and maximum temperature, respectively. On the contrary, cell division in the cambium stopped in July-August, when temperatures were still high. Main conclusions Wood formation in conifers occurred when specific critical temperatures were reached. Although the timing and duration of xylogenesis varied among species, sites and years, the estimated temperatures were stable for all trees studied. These results provide biologically based evidence that temperature is a critical factor limiting production and differentiation of xylem cells in cold climates. Although daily temperatures below 4-5 degrees C are still favourable for photosynthesis, thermal conditions below these values could inhibit the allocation of assimilated carbon to structural investment, i.e. xylem growth.}

  abstract = {Temperature is the most important factor driving the cold edge distribution limit of temperate trees. Here, we identified the minimum temperatures for root growth in seven broad-leaved tree species, compared them with the species' natural elevational limits and identified morphological changes in roots produced near their physiological cold limit. Seedlings were exposed to a vertical soil-temperature gradient from 20 to 2\>{$^\circ$}C along the rooting zone for 18\>weeks. In all species, the bulk of roots was produced at temperatures above 5\>{$^\circ$}C. However, the absolute minimum temperatures for root growth differed among species between 2.3 and 4.2\>{$^\circ$}C, with those species that reach their natural distribution limits at higher elevations also tending to have lower thermal limits for root tissue formation. In all investigated species, the roots produced at temperatures close to the thermal limit were pale, thick, unbranched and of reduced mechanical strength. Across species, the specific root length (m\>g-1 root) was reduced by, on average, 60\% at temperatures below 7\>{$^\circ$}C. A significant correlation of minimum temperatures for root growth with the natural high elevation limits of the investigated species indicates species-specific thermal requirements for basic physiological processes. Although these limits are not necessarily directly causative for the upper distribution limit of a species, they seem to belong to a syndrome of adaptive processes for life at low temperatures. The anatomical changes at the cold limit likely hint at the mechanisms impeding meristematic activity at low temperatures.},

  abstract = {Nutrient loading of nursery seedling stock of species with an indeterminate growth strategy is challenging and poorly understood. Here, we explore the use of two potential techniques for nutrient loading of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings: (1) exponential fertilization and (2) early shoot growth termination in order to divert assimilated nutrients and carbon to storage rather than to growth. In the first study, aspen seedlings were treated with either exponential or constant fertilization rates, both of which supplied the same amount of nutrients over the growing season. Exponential fertilization resulted in overall poor planting stock form (stunted seedling growth and weak root development) and produced only marginal improvements of nutrient status. As a result, the exponential fertilization regime studied cannot be recommended as a treatment for aspen seedlings. In the second study we treated seedlings with a 2~{\texttimes}~2 factorial combination of fertilization and shoot growth inhibitor (SGI) applications with the fertilizer treatments varying in terms of mid-season fertilizer concentrations. Seedlings with SGI application had much higher tissue nutrient and carbon reserve concentrations than seedlings without a SGI application. In addition, nutrient uptake appeared to be more efficient in SGI treated seedlings, which could potentially result in significant reductions of nutrient application rates during aspen seedling production in nurseries. Overall, early shoot growth termination using a SGI appears to be an effective technique to produce nutrient loaded aspen seedlings.},

  abstract = {Plant phenology is expected to be sensitive to climate warming. In boreal trees, spring flush is primarily temperature driven, whereas height growth cessation and autumn leaf senescence are predominantly controlled by photoperiod. Cuttings of 525 genotypes from the full range of balsam poplar were planted into two common gardens (Vancouver and Indian Head, Canada) at similar latitudes, but with differing winter temperatures and growing seasons. There was clinal variation in spring and, particularly, summer and fall phenology. Bud flush and, despite milder climate, bud set and leaf drop were earlier at Vancouver than at Indian Head by 44, 28 and 7 d, respectively. Although newly flushed growth is insensitive to photoperiod, many genotypes at both sites became competent before the summer solstice. At Vancouver, high-latitude genotypes set dormant terminal buds in mid-spring. Most other genotypes grew until midsummer or set bud temporarily and then experienced a second flush. In both gardens and in a growth chamber experiment, earlier bud set was associated with reduced height growth and higher root/shoot ratios. Shoots attained competency {$\sim$}5 weeks after flushing, which would normally prevent dormancy induction before the solstice, but may be insufficient if spring advances by more than a few weeks.},

  abstract = {The onset of spring growth and vessel formation were examined within three deciduous woody plant species, Acer rubrum, Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa and Quercus rubra. We were broadly interested in the lag between the onset of girth expansion and the formation of mature and hydraulically conductive vessels within the new xylem.Dendrometers were installed on 20 trees (6--7 per species), and expansion of both bole and distal stems was monitored throughout the growing season in a common garden. For each species, four to six distal stems were harvested every other week for anatomical examination of vessel formation. Additionally, for Populus and Quercus, hydraulic conductivity measurements and active xylem staining were completed on all stem samples.For all three species, the timing of girth expansion was similar. Expansion of distal branches occurred 12--37 d earlier than that of the bole. Vessel formation initiated several weeks prior to leaf-out, but no new earlywood vessels were mature at the time of bud break for Acer and Populus and only a few were present in Quercus. Initial stem girth expansion occurred 2 to \&gt;6 weeks before the maturation of the first current-year vessels, and there was an additional delay of up to 4 weeks before mature vessels became hydraulically functional. Hydraulic conductivity was strongly correlated with the number and diameter of stained vessels.Bud break and leaf expansion relied predominantly on water supplied by vessels formed during prior seasons. Early-season activity is likely affected by the function of older xylem vessels and the environmental factors that influence their structure and function. Understanding the functional lifespan of vessels and the varying contributions of new and older vessels to conductivity are critical to understanding of the phenology and vascular function of long-lived woody plants in response to changing climates.},

Annual dry seasons in eastern Amazonia provoke periodical cambial activity which may be measured as variation in girth increment and is recorded in the wood anatomy as well as its density. Gamma radiation densitometry is discouraged because of poor results. X-ray densitometry and the radiocarbon method are promising but must be refined.

Yet future growing-season trajectories remain highly uncertain because the environmental drivers of autumn leaf senescence are poorly understood. Using experiments and long-term observations, we show that increases in spring and summer productivity due to elevated carbon dioxide, temperature, or light levels drive earlier senescence. Accounting for this effect improved the accuracy of senescence predictions by 27 to 42\% and reversed future predictions from a previously expected 2- to 3-week delay over the rest of the century to an advance of 3 to 6 days. These findings demonstrate the critical role of sink limitation in governing the end of seasonal activity and reveal important constraints on future growing-season lengths and carbon uptake of trees.},

  abstract = {Global warming has generally advanced the spring phenology of extratropical trees. In several cases, however, the advancing has levelled off, indicating a declining temperature sensitivity of phenological timing. The po\- tential reasons for the decline have been actively debated, but no direct experimental evidence has been pro\- duced to support any of the theories put forward. With the aid of scenario simulations, we examined which ecophysiological tree traits restrict the advancing of the onset of spring phenology in four subtropical tree species under global warming. In the simulations, we applied process-based tree spring phenology models formulated on the basis of results of experiments specifically designed for examining the ecophysiological responses addressed. We identified three restricting ecophysiological traits: 1) the chilling effect operates at relatively low tempera\- tures only, 2) the temperature sensitivity of spring phenology is low in the temperature range of +10 to +20 {\textopenbullet}C which is critical under climatic warming in subtropical conditions; and 3) the winter rest is deep. Unexpectedly, a high chilling requirement was not included amongst the restricting ecophysiological traits. Our experimentallybased results show that the spring phenology of the trees under climatic warming is significantly affected by seemingly small and usually neglected details of the ecophysiological responses to chilling and forcing temperatures.},

  abstract = {Earlier leaf-out and later autumn leaf senescence under climate warming have been linked to increases in plant productivity and ecosystem carbon uptake. Yet, despite the potential implications of shifting phenology for plant carbon uptake, the degree to which phenological changes affect overall plant growth and the partitioning between above- and below-ground biomass remains unclear. Here we use a 3-year experiment to quantify changes in root and shoot growth of three woody plant species (two common European tree species, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, and one shrub Lonicera xylosteum) under spring and autumn warming. In both tree species, the magnitude---and in Quercus even the direction---of the effects of growing-season length on growth depends on whether the warming happened in spring or in autumn. Each day earlier leaf-out in response to warming resulted in total biomass increases of 0.8\%--2.5\%, whereas delayed senescence led to reductions of 0.2\%--2.1\%. Advances in leaf-out also led to increased root-to-shoot biomass ratios because root growth was proportionally more stimulated than shoot growth. In the shrub species, earlier leaf-out had no effect, while delayed senescence led to increases in root, but not shoot, biomass. Synthesis. The strong asymmetry between growth responses to spring versus autumn phenology demonstrates that growing-season length per se is a weak indicator of individual-level tree productivity. The results further imply that phenological shifts are reshaping the functional balance between above- and below-ground growth, which is critical for quantifying forest carbon dynamics under climate change.},

Here, we analyze LSFs between 1959 and 2017 and the resistance strategies of Northern Hemisphere woody species to infer trees' adaptations for minimizing frost damage to their leaves and to forecast forest vulnerability under the ongoing changes in frost frequencies. Trait values on leaf-out and leaf-freezing resistance come from up to 1,500 temperate and boreal woody species cultivated in common gardens. We find that areas in which LSFs are common, such as eastern North America, harbor tree species with cautious (late-leafing) leaf-out strategies. Areas in which LSFs used to be unlikely, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). LSFs in the latter regions are currently increasing, and given species' innate resistance strategies, we estimate that similar to 35\% of the European and similar to 26\% of the Asian temperate forest area, but only similar to 10\% of the North American, will experience increasing late-frost damage in the future. Our findings reveal region-specific changes in the spring-frost risk that can inform decision-making in land management, forestry, agriculture, and insurance policy.},
