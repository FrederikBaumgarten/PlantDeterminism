  abstract = {Globally, root production accounts for 33--67\% of terrestrial net primary productivity and influences decomposition via root production and turnover, carbon (C) allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and root exudation. As recognized above ground, the timing of phenological events affects terrestrial C balance, yet there is no parallel understanding for below-ground phenology. In this paper we examine the phenology of root production and its relationship to temperature, soil moisture, and above-ground phenology. Synthesizing 87 observations of whole-plant phenology from 40 studies, we found that, on average, root growth occurs 25 {\textpm} 8 d after shoot growth but that the offset between the peak in root and shoot growth varies {$>$} 200 d across biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical). Root and shoot growth are positively correlated with median monthly temperature and mean monthly precipitation in boreal, temperate, and subtropical biomes. However, a temperature hysteresis in these biomes leads to the hypothesis that internal controls over C allocation to roots are an equally, if not more, important driver of phenology. The specific mechanisms are as yet unclear but they are likely mediated by some combination of photoassimilate supply, hormonal signaling, and growth form.},

Architectural studies have been carried out for some twenty years and have led to the definition of several concepts that provide a powerful tool for studying plant form. The results obtained in this field show that the architecture of a plant can be summarized by a small number of elementary structures: internode, growth unit, axis, architectural model,... In the course of ontogenesis, these structures are repeated and reveal several levels of organization that seem to be only different stages of a common process of growth and transformation.},

The aim of architectural analysis is, by means of observation and sometimes experimentation, to identify and understand these endogenous processes and to separate them from the plasticity of their expression resulting from external influences.Using the identification of several morphological criteria and considering the plant as a whole, from germination to death, architectural analysis is essentially a detailed, multilevel, comprehensive and dynamic approach to plant development. Despite their recent origin, architectural concepts and analysis methods provide a powerful tool for studying plant form and ontogeny. Completed by precise morphological observations and appropriated quantitative methods of analysis, recent researches in this field have greatly increased our understanding of plant structure and development and have led to the establishment of a real conceptual and methodological framework for plant form and structure analysis and representation. This paper is a summarized update of current knowledge on plant architecture and morphology; its implication and possible role in various aspects of modern plant biology is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Phenological shifts in response to changing climatic conditions is a key acclimation process for the persistence of perennial plants in temperate and boreal climates. The optimal time to leaf-out is the result of an evolutionary process determined by the trade-off between minimizing the risk of freezing damages and herbivory pressure while maximizing resource uptake to increase competitiveness against the other plants. We quantified the penalty exerted by frost damage at the time of leaf emergence on plant development (reduction in leaf area, canopy duration and growth) over the potential gains without frost (increased biomass and non-structural carbohydrate reserves), depending on when leaf-out occurs. To this purpose, we exposed 960 saplings of four temperate deciduous tree species with contrasting cold hardiness to two frost intensities shortly after leaf emergence, which was artificially induced at four occasions to reflect the whole range of natural leaf-out dates. One year above-ground biomass (AGB) increments following the frost revealed a clear ranking among the species depending on their strategy to cope with damaging frosts. Prunus avium (-41\% of AGB-increment compared to control saplings) resprouted from the stem base, Quercus robur (-62\%) rapidly produced new leaves from dormant reserve buds, Fagus sylvatica (-98\%) showed highest chlorophyll content in autumn and delayed senescence together with Carpinus betulus (-105\%), which overcompensated NSC reserves after the growing season but showed highest mortality (up to 32\%). In all species, NSC reserves recovered rapidly to control levels at the expense of growth. The timing of leaf-out (advanced and delayed artificially) significantly affected the performance and recovery (regreening and growth) of both frozen and non-frozen saplings, with the lowest performance found at the most delayed leaf-out date. We propose that the potential to recover from frost damages is an important component of a tree's performance, particularly at the juvenile stage. The ability to recover may become even more decisive in the future with the predicted increase of false springs in many extratropical regions.

Unexpectedly, however, it also controls the short-day--induced growth cessation and bud set occurring in the fall. This regulatory mechanism can explain the ecogenetic variation in a highly adaptive trait: the critical daylength for growth cessation displayed by aspen trees sampled across a latitudinal gradient spanning northern Europe.},

In the early successional species the architectural development pattern and growth design are geared to maximize production under high light environments. These trees have an indeterminate pattern of shoot growth, a prolonged growth period with greater extension growth and rhythmicity (except for A. nepalensis with continuous growth) and branch mainly by syllepsis. These species emphasize vertical growth at the expense of lateral spread. In contrast, the late successional species make modest growth under a determinate scheme, the growth being confined to preformed bud primordia for a brief period of the growing season. There is less rhythmicity in growth and branch productin is by prolepsis. These species emphasize lateral spread, as an adaptation to highly competitive environments. In forest situations these species have one determinate flush of shoot growth only but in open situations there were two such flushes. Bifurcation ratio values are found to vary in forest and open situations, suggesting the capacity of the species to adjust their architecture to changed light conditions.},

Rhythmic growth in trees would be the consequence of feedback mechanisms needed for maintaining a constant shoot: root ratio. Period length of the rhythms depends upon the rates of the growth processes involved. Environmental factors modify period length through affecting growth rates. Growth patterns predicted by the model compare well with growth measurements of tropical trees. The transition from intermittent to continuous growth, as observed under certain conditions, can be simulated by varying a single parameter in the model.},

However, there are indications that increased growth rates may shorten trees{$\prime$} lifespan and thus recent increases in forest carbon stocks may be transient due to lagged increases in mortality. Here we show that growth-lifespan trade-offs are indeed near universal, occurring across almost all species and climates. This trade-off is directly linked to faster growth reducing tree lifespan, and not due to covariance with climate or environment. Thus, current tree growth stimulation will, inevitably, result in a lagged increase in canopy tree mortality, as is indeed widely observed, and eventually neutralise carbon gains due to growth stimulation. Results from a strongly data-based forest simulator confirm these expectations. Extant Earth system model projections of global forest carbon sink persistence are likely too optimistic, increasing the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}New insights into the intra-annual dynamics of tree-ring formation can improve our understanding of tree-growth response to environmental conditions at high-resolution time scales. Obtaining this information requires, however, a weekly monitoring of wood formation, sampling that is extremely time-intensive and scarcely feasible over vast areas. Estimating the timing of cambial and xylem differentiation by modeling thus represents an interesting alternative for obtaining this important information by other means. Temporal dynamics of cambial divisions can be extracted from the daily tree-ring growth rate computed by the Vaganov--Shashkin (VS) simulation model, assuming that cell production is tightly linked to tree-ring growth. Nonetheless, these predictions have yet to be compared with direct observations of wood development, i.e., {$<$}italic{$>$}via{$<$}/italic{$>$} microcoring, over a long time span. We tested the performance of the VS model by comparing the observed and predicted timing of wood formation in black spruce [{$<$}italic{$>$}Picea mariana{$<$}/italic{$>$} (Mill.)]. We obtained microcores over 15 years at 5 sites along a latitudinal gradient in Quebec (Canada). The measured variables included cell size and the timing of cell production and differentiation. We calibrated the VS model using daily temperature and precipitation recorded by weather stations located on each site. The predicted and observed timing of cambial and enlarging cells were highly correlated ({$<$}italic{$>$}R{$<$}/italic{$>$}\textsuperscript{2} = 0.8); nonetheless, we detected a systematic overestimation in the predicted timing of cambial cells, with predictions delayed by 1--20 days compared with observations. The growth rate of cell diameter was correlated with the predicted growth rate assigned to each cambial cell, confirming that cell diameter developmental dynamics have the potential to be inferred by the tree-ring growth curve of the VS model. Model performances decrease substantially in estimating the end of wood formation. The systematic errors suggest that the actual relationships implemented in the model are unable to explain the phenological events in autumn.

  abstract = {Wood density is the product of carbon allocation for structural growth and reflects the trade-off between mechanical support and water conductivity. We tested a conceptual framework based on the assumption that micro-density depends on direct and indirect relationships with endogenous and exogenous factors. The dynamics of wood formation, including timings and rates of cell division, cell enlargement, and secondary wall deposition, were assessed from microcores collected weekly between 2002 and 2016 from five black spruce stands located along a latitudinal gradient in Quebec, Canada. Cell anatomy and micro-density were recorded by anatomical analyses and X-ray measurements. Our structural equation model explained 80\% of micro-density variation within the tree-ring with direct effects of wall thickness ({$\sigma$} = 0.61), cell diameter ({$\sigma$} = -0.51), and photoperiod ({$\sigma$} = -0.26). Wood formation dynamics had an indirect effect on micro-density. Micro-density increased under longer periods of cell-wall deposition and shorter durations of enlargement. Our results fill a critical gap in understanding the relationships underlying micro-density variation in conifers. We demonstrated that short-term responses to environmental variations could be overridden by plastic responses that modulate cell differentiation. Our results point to wood formation dynamics as a reliable predictor of carbon allocation in trees.},

  abstract = {Aim In boreal ecosystems, phenological events display seasonal patterns. These patterns allow for the development of tissues during the short time window available for growth in cold climates. Primary and secondary growth, two expensive processes for plants, are supposedly modulated in time to optimize allocation of carbon to bud and woody tissues. We aimed to assess the phenology of primary and secondary meristems, testing their relationship over the closed black spruce stands of the commercially exploited forest region in Quebec, Canada. Location Quebec, Canada. Time period 2002--2016. Major taxa studied Gymnospermae. Methods We combined weekly scaled field observations with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to extract timings of photosynthesis and meristem growth in five black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] stands located along a latitudinal gradient and to assess their relationship. We then tested empirical models based on geographical position and seasonal temperatures to predict wood phenology (i.e., the onset and ending of earlywood and latewood formation), and compared its spatial patterns with existing predictions of bud phenology for the same study area. Results Photosynthesis started at the beginning of May, 3 weeks before bud reactivation and the onset of wood growth. Latewood formation started in mid-July, after shoot elongation was completed. For wood phenology models, the residual standard error ranged from 1 week to 12 days. Growth dynamics spatialized across the boreal forest of Quebec varied with the transition between the subarctic and humid continental climate. Main conclusions Shoot elongation and latewood formation were temporally separated, providing evidence of a trade-off in structural carbon allocation between primary and secondary growth in trees. Spatial patterns of wood phenology predicted for the black spruce polygons are consistent with spatial patterns of bud phenology, demonstrating synchronized temporal dynamics of meristems at the regional scale.},

The number of shoots regenerated per explant and the number of explants regenerating shoots were then determined after 60 days in culture. Six genotypes were recalcitrant and failed to regenerate shoots. Two genotypes were initially competent for shoot regeneration and consistently regenerated the greatest number of shoots when cultured directly onto shoot inducing medium. Shoot regeneration for the remaining seven genotypes was significantly enhanced by culture on callus-inducing medium for 1--8 days prior to transfer to shoot inducing medium. When internodal explants were cultured on callus-inducing medium for 10 days before transfer to shoot inducing medium, all 15 genotypes failed to regenerate shoots. Regeneration of the nine genotypes that were not recalcitrant was enhanced over the one year period by repeated stock plant hedging. Stock plant hedging was performed by pruning stock plants in such a manner that approximately 4 cm of current stem growth remained. Stock plants were repeatedly hedged at three to four month intervals over the one year experimental period.},

The expansion time of leaves is \&lt;1 month. Main shoots (first-order axis, A1 shoots) extended over 30\,d and they did not branch. BR budding and foliage unfolds were brought about independently of inter-annual rainfall variations. By contrast, in LL and MA evergreen species, the shoot extension rate and the neoformation of aerial organs depended on rainfall. Leaf emergence was continuous for 2--6 months and lamina expansion took place over 1--4 months. The leaf life span was 5--20 months and the main A1 shoot extension happened over 122--177\,d. Both evergreen species allocated biomass to shoots, leaves or flowers continuously during the year, branching in the middle of the wet season to form second-order (A2 shoots) and third-order (A3 shoots) axis in LL and A2 shoots in MA. Partial shed of A1 shoot leaves would facilitate a higher branching intensity A2 shoot production in LL than in MA. MA presented a longer leaf life span, produced a lower percentage of A2 shoots but had a higher meristem persistence on A1 and A2 shoots than LL.{$\bullet$} Conclusions It was possible to identify different patterns of aerial growth in Cerrado woody species defined by shoot-linked traits such as branching pattern, bud composition, meristem persistence and leaf phenology. These related traits must be considered over and above leaf deciduousness for searching functional guilds in a Cerrado woody community. For the first time a relationship between bud composition, shoot growth and leaf production pattern is found in savanna woody plants.},

Current life-history theory does not offer a consistent view on the origin of this diversity. We use dynamic optimization to examine resource allocation in seasonal environments, considering that offspring produced at different times of the season have unequal future prospects. Reduction of these prospects during the season produced indeterminate growers that grew mostly after maturation, achieving large final body sizes. It also changed the optimal timing of growth and reproduction during a season, from grow-first-reproduce-later, as usually predicted by life-history theory, to the reproduce-first-grow-later tactic; other tactics were produced by the interactive effects of winter survival and unequal offspring prospects. The results suggest that devaluation of offspring production provides conditions for the evolution of capital breeding, even in fully predictable seasonal environments. Thus, the unequal fate of newborns from different parts of a season may explain the origin of diversity of reproductive phenologies, growth patterns, and capital breeding in nature.},

  abstract = {Leaf senescence in winter deciduous species signals the transition from the active to the dormant stage. The purpose of leaf senescence is the recovery of nutrients before the leaves fall. Photoperiod and temperature are the main cues controlling leaf senescence in winter deciduous species, with water stress imposing an additional influence. Photoperiod exerts a strict control on leaf senescence at latitudes where winters are severe and temperature gains importance in the regulation as winters become less severe. On average, climatic warming will delay and drought will advance leaf senescence, but at varying degrees depending on the species. Warming and drought thus have opposite effects on the phenology of leaf senescence, and the impact of climate change will therefore depend on the relative importance of each factor in specific regions. Warming is not expected to have a strong impact on nutrient proficiency although a slower speed of leaf senescence induced by warming could facilitate a more efficient nutrient resorption. Nutrient resorption is less efficient when the leaves senesce prematurely as a consequence of water stress. The overall effects of climate change on nutrient resorption will depend on the contrasting effects of warming and drought. Changes in nutrient resorption and proficiency will impact production in the following year, at least in early spring, because the construction of new foliage relies almost exclusively on nutrients resorbed from foliage during the preceding leaf fall. Changes in the phenology of leaf senescence will thus impact carbon uptake, but also ecosystem nutrient cycling, especially if the changes are consequence of water stress.},

Yet, their applicability to extremely slow-growing trees, such as those in peatlands, has been limited due to the intricate and slow nature of growth, therefore rendering interpretation of results complex. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive monitoring of tree wood formation in both peatland and mineral soil ecosystems in southern Sweden (58.37\,N, 12.17 E, 75\,m asl) in 2021 and 2022, using both band and point dendrometers. To verify and validate the dendrometer data, we also sampled microcores every two weeks during both growing seasons. We find that peatland trees grow at approximately 30 \% the rate of their neighbors on mineral soils. The onset of growth among peatland trees typically occurs between mid-May and early June, consistently lagging the start of the growing season in trees on mineral soils by one to three weeks. Notably, growth peaks are synchronized across peatland trees and coincide with the summer solstice. Both types of dendrometers exhibit varying degrees of accuracy depending on the phenological stages measured. They perform well in identifying growth onset and peak but are less effective at detecting growth cessation. Point dendrometers demonstrate superior accuracy as they better capture daily irreversible growth increments. In the case of band dendrometers, growth increments are obscured by greater reversible fluctuations in dead bark tissues. However, they remain valuable for tracking the wood phenology of trees with growth rates exceeding 2\,mm/year. Based on our results, for an effective tree monitoring in peatlands, we strongly recommend (1) using point dendrometers and (2) removing the dead bark tissues on monitored trees.},

  abstract = {Moringa peregrina (Forssk.) Fiori, one of 13 species of the Moringaceae family widely distributed throughout the dry tropics, has the potential to become one of the most economically important medicinal plants in Egypt. However, despite its tolerance for drought and heat, it is also threatened by increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation. Although the phenophase of this species is well documented, almost nothing is known about its period of cambial activity in desert regions. Ring formation and the general environmental adaptability of trees are affected by the timing of cambial activation. In our study site, we observe a distinct coupling of the development of new green leaves at the onset of vegetative growth in October and the phase of cambial activity (November--January). The onset of cambial activity seems to be related to a drop in temperature in October and the onset of torrential rains in the region. There might even be a short phase between the end of cambial activity and the onset of bud formation without xylem formation, but with photosynthetic activity. If so, we assume that all assimilates are stored as non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in the parenchyma of the new ring. This potential gap opens new questions regarding the correlation between NSC storage capacity and the timing of remobilization for subsequent ring formation.},

  abstract = {Polycyclism, the ability for a plant to produce several flushes in the same growing season, is a key process of plant development. Polycyclism frequency is likely to change with the anticipated climate trend, expected to impact plant growth over the next century. However, polycyclism processes are not well described in the literature, and an important lack of knowledge prevents any possible prediction for the twenty-first century. Aleppo pine is a good model to study polycyclism: it is known to produce up to four annual flushes in one growing season. In this study, we used architectural analysis to describe and reconstruct polycyclism processes, periodicity and frequency on Aleppo pine in a Mediterranean site for the last 15~years. We also assessed relationships between polycyclism frequency and climate. Since 1995, climate was far hotter and drier than normal in South-eastern France: polycyclism was significantly reduced, particularly after 2003 heat-wave, which delayed effect remains till 2008, exacerbated by repeated droughts. Morphologically, polycyclism is primarily influenced by twig vigour, status (principal/secondary and strong axes) and position (low, middle or top crown). Climatically, it depends on summer temperatures of the current and preceding year, rainfall of the first half of preceding year and winter rainfall. Previous year abundant rainfall combined with colder temperatures and high rainfall in spring or at the end of summer of the current year increase tricyclism frequency. Polycyclism is likely to decrease significantly in the twenty-first century due to a hotter and drier climate.},

In recent years, climate change and associated water stress have been pushing some forests to the limit (Adams et al., 2009). For example, in California over 129 million trees have died during recent droughts (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, 2018). Given the central role of trees in mitigating and responding to climate change, it is surprising that there are still fundamental features of how trees grow, adjust their development and physiology for environmental conditions, and transport water through their woody bodies that remain poorly understood. The new paper by Valdovinos-Ayala et al. (2022) in this issue provides new insights into the seasonal cycles of perennial growth in angiosperm trees, and how this is related to the development and function of water-conducting tissues. Along the way, this work also presents new questions and exposes basic knowledge gaps regarding the annual growth cycles of trees and their ability to transport water and mitigate variations in the environment.},

  abstract = {Growth in perennial plants possesses an annual cycle of active growth and dormancy that is controlled by environmental factors, mainly photoperiod and temperature. In conifers and other nonangiosperm species, the molecular mechanisms behind these responses are currently unknown. In Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) seedlings, growth cessation and bud set are induced by short days and plants from southern latitudes require at least 7 to 10 h of darkness, whereas plants from northern latitudes need only 2 to 3 h of darkness. Bud burst, on the other hand, is almost exclusively controlled by temperature. To test the possible role of Norway spruce FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-like genes in growth rhythm, we have studied expression patterns of four Norway spruce FT family genes in two populations with a divergent bud set response under various photoperiodic conditions. Our data show a significant and tight correlation between growth rhythm (both bud set and bud burst), and expression pattern of one of the four Norway spruce phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein gene family members (PaFT4) over a variety of experimental conditions. This study strongly suggests that one Norway spruce homolog to the FT gene, which controls flowering in angiosperms, is also a key integrator of photoperiodic and thermal signals in the control of growth rhythms in gymnosperms. The data also indicate that the divergent adaptive bud set responses of northern and southern Norway spruce populations, both to photoperiod and light quality, are mediated through PaFT4. These results provide a major advance in our understanding of the molecular control of a major adaptive trait in conifers and a tool for further molecular studies of adaptive variation in plants.},

  abstract = {Global warming has been shown to affect weather and climate extremes, such as droughts, floods, windstorms, cold waves, and heat waves. A number of studies have focused on the variability of different characteristics of these extremes, including their frequency, spatial extent, and severity. Recently, the study of compound extremes, defined by the co-occurrence of multiple events with extreme impacts, has attracted much attention. The compound dry and hot extreme is one type of compound extreme and may lead to detrimental impacts on the society and ecosystem. Most previous studies have focused on changes in the frequency or spatial extent of compound dry and hot extremes, while assessments of changes in the severity of compound extremes are lacking. This study evaluated changes in the severity of compound dry and hot extremes at the global scale, based on the Standardized Dry and Hot Index (SDHI). A significant increase in the severity of compound dry and hot extremes (or decrease of the SDHI value) during the warm season was found in western US, northern South America, western Europe, Africa, western Asia, southeastern Asia, southern India, northeastern China and eastern Australia. Moreover, a significant temporal increase in the average severity of the hottest month over global land areas was also observed. Results from this study highlight the increased severity of compound dry and hot extremes over global land areas and call for improved efforts on assessing the impact of compound extremes under global warming.},

In many plants, the environment controls the production of a floral stimulus, which moves from the leaves to the shoot apex. Apices can become committed to the continuous production of flowers after the receipt of sufficient amounts of floral stimulus. However, in some plants, the commitment to continued flower production is evidently caused by a plant's commitment to perpetually produce floral stimulus in the leaves. Ultimately, the induction of flowering leads to the specification of flowers at the shoot apex. In Arabidopsis, floral specification and inflorescence patterning are regulated largely by the interactions between the genes TERMINAL FLOWER, LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER.},

Comparison of measured features (length, number of axillary products, reproductive organs) at common ages from the three stands supported the validity of using these data to form a continuous chronosequence. Endogenous trends in tree development are revealed free from variability due to annual growth conditions. Two main phases of development corresponding respectively to the juvenile vegetative and adult reproductive stages were identified, and the transition between both occurred in 9-yr-old trees. The relevance of these two phases and more generally the notion of phase changes are discussed in light of observed trends in the values of studied growth and branching parameters that may either show gradual variations (such as length of annual shoot) or a distinctive expression in one or the other phase (such as presence of female cones).},

Except for turgor-mediated processes, the physicochemical basis for the transduction of small changes in water status into alterations in metabolism remains obscure. Turgor pressure is assigned a critical role in cell growth: the physical force needed to sustain enlargement. Simple physical models relating growth to turgor are conceptually useful in examining effects of water stress but can be misleading because metabolic and regulatory responses may be marked and vary temporally. Osmotic adjustment has long been known as a means by which higher plants adapt to salinity, with much of the cell osmotica being ionic and accumulated from the medium. Though not generally recognized, osmotic adjustment also appears to be an important mechanism for adaptation to water-limiting conditions, even in mesophytic plants. In this case much of the osmotica might possibly be internally generated. Recent field data on seasonal and diurnal adjustment and vertical water-potential gradients in plant canopies are discussed relative to growth and water-potential components.},

We show that in perennial Arabis alpina, flowering in response to winter cold depends on the floral integrator SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15 (SPL15), whose activity is limited to older shoots and branches during cold exposure. In annuals, this regulatory system is conserved, but cold-induced flowering occurs in young shoots, without requirement for SPL15, through the photoperiodic pathway when plants return to warm. By reconstructing the annual response in perennials, we conclude that characteristic patterns of reproduction in annuals and perennials are conferred through variation in dependency on distinct flowering pathways acting in parallel.},

  abstract = {The optimal growth schedule of a deciduous perennial plant is studied theoretically. We make three basic assumptions. First, the daily net photosynthetic rate of a plant increases but saturates with the size of the production part (vegetative organs working for photosynthesis). Second, the production part is discarded at the end of a growing season, but it may be rebuilt at the beginning of the next season using stored material. And finally, the plant maximizes the lifetime reproductive investment by choosing both the growth schedule within each season and the resource allocation between reproduction for the year and storage for the next season. The model is analyzed by the combination of maximum principle and dynamic programming. Our analysis showed three basic results. First, the annual life cycle is optimal under low storage efficiency, low habitat reliability, low growth rate, and a short growing season. Second, under any other conditions, perennial growth is optimal. During years in which the final amount of resources is smaller than a critical value S*, the plant remains immature and saves all of the resources for the next season. If it becomes larger than S*, the plant invests the excess in reproductive activities and repeats the same growth schedule thereafter (steady state). Finally, reproductive effort (the ratio of reproductive investment to total annual production) of a mature plant is high for an annual, is lowest for a perennial just above the threshold for the perennial growth pattern, increases as the length of the season increases, and in a very productive habitat may even exceed the level for an annual. The ratio of the plant size established by stored material to the maximum plant size decreases with the length of the growing season, which quantitatively fits the available data. In light of the model, reported growth patterns and leaf phenology of many deciduous plants indicate that the nonlinearity of photosynthetic rate as a function of the size of the production part is important. For a case with nonlinear photosynthesis but without an upper limit to the leaf expansion rate, a plant's optimal phenology, if normalized by size, can be parameterized by two quantities: productivity (maximum relative growth rate multiplied by a season's length) and stability (annual survival multiplied by storage efficiency). The timing of the cessation of leaf production within a season by a small immature plant is determined by productivity (occurring later in a more productive habitat). Leaf production ends earlier in the season as the plant grows. The optimal time for ending leaf production in a mature plant, in contrast, is controlled mainly by stability (it ceases earlier at a more stable site) and is almost independent of productivity.},

  abstract = {Tree growth is an important indicator of forest health and can reflect changes in forest structure. Traditional tree growth estimates use easy-to-measure parameters, including tree height, diameter at breast height, and crown diameter, obtained via forest in situ measurements, which are labor intensive and time consuming. Some new technologies measure the diameter of trees at different positions to monitor the growth trend of trees, but it is difficult to take into account the growth changes at different tree levels. The combination of terrestrial laser scanning and quantitative structure modeling can accurately estimate tree structural parameters nondestructively and has the potential to estimate tree growth from different tree levels. In this context, this paper estimates tree growth from stem-, crown-, and branch-level attributes observed by terrestrial laser scanning. Specifically, tree height, diameter at breast height, stem volume, crown diameter, crown volume, and first-order branch volume were used to estimate the growth of 55-year-old larch trees in Saihanba of China, at the stem, crown, and branch levels. The experimental results showed that tree growth is mainly reflected in the growth of the crown, i.e., the growth of branches. Compared to one-dimensional parameter growth (tree height, diameter at breast height, or crown diameter), three-dimensional parameter growth (crown, stem, and first-order branch volumes) was more obvious, in which the absolute growth of the first-order branch volume is close to the stem volume. Thus, it is necessary to estimate tree growth at different levels for accurate forest inventory.},

We investigated the factors contributing to masting synchrony in European beech (Fagus sylvatica), which extends to a geographic range of 2,000\,km. Maximizing masting synchrony via spatial weather coordination, known as the Moran effect, requires a simultaneous response to weather conditions across distant populations. A celestial cue that occurs simultaneously across the entire hemisphere is the longest day (the summer solstice). We show that European beech abruptly opens its temperature-sensing window on the solstice, and hence widely separated populations all start responding to weather signals in the same week. This celestial `starting gun' generates ecological events with high spatial synchrony across the continent.},

Life history studies would benefit from a better understanding of strategies and mechanisms of growth, but still no comparative research on individual growth strategies has been conducted. Growth patterns and methods have been shaped by evolution and a great variety of them are observed. Two distinct patterns -- determinate and indeterminate growth -- are of a special interest for these studies since they present qualitatively different outcomes of evolution. We attempt to draw together studies covering growth in plant and animal species across a wide range of phyla focusing primarily on the noted qualitative features. We also review mathematical descriptions of growth, namely empirical growth curves and growth models, and discuss the directions of future research.},

Seedlings from open-pollinated families (160 total) from two inland (dry) and two coastal (wet) sources were grown under either well-watered or intermittent drought conditions (temporary drought followed by rewatering) for two growing seasons. In the first growing season, the results supported the hypothesis: the frequency of a second flush was genetically controlled (although weakly, hf2 {$\leq$} 0.34); more seedlings, on average, from inland families than from coastal families displayed a second flush; and seedlings from inland families were more responsive to the intermittent drought regime in terms of increased frequency of a second flush (relative to the frequency in the well-watered regime). During the second growing season, the intermittent drought treatment did not promote intermittent shoot growth, although inland and coastal families had different patterns of shoot growth that reflected adaptations to soil water availability. We conclude that inland families have adapted to dry summers and short growing seasons by relying predominantly on predetermined growth for seedling height increment after the first growing season. In response to wetter and generally longer growing seasons, however, coastal families have developed a less regulated pattern of shoot extension and rely more on free growth.},

Despite its importance, current understanding of the drivers of senescence is limited, leading to a large spread in predictions of how the timing of senescence, and thus the length of the growing season, will change under future climate conditions. The most commonly held paradigm is that temperature and photoperiod are the primary controls, which suggests a future extension of the autumnal growing season as global temperatures rise. Here, using two decades of ground- and satellite-based observations of temperate deciduous forest phenology, we show that the timing of autumn senescence is correlated with the timing of spring budburst across the entire eastern United States. On a year-to-year basis, an earlier/later spring was associated with an earlier/later autumn senescence, both for individual species and at a regional scale. We use the observed relationship to develop a novel model of autumn phenology. In contrast to current phenology models, this model predicts that the potential response of autumn phenology to future climate change is strongly limited by the impact of climate change on spring phenology. Current models of autumn phenology therefore may overpredict future increases in the length of the growing season, with subsequent impacts for modeling future CO2 uptake and evapotranspiration.},

Three types of leaf-emergence pattern were recognized; namely (1) succeeding type, (2) intermediate type, and (3) flush type. The two species showing the succeeding type emergence pattern have homonomous winter buds characterized by one-lamina and two-stipules sets. The species of intermediate- or flush-type emergence pattern usually have heteronomous winter buds with several bud scales. A negative correlation was found between leaf-emergence duration and number of bud scales. Species having a long leaf-emergence duration were open land or gap invaders. Among them, those having long leaf-fall duration were found in riverside forests. On the other hand, species showing flush-type leaf emergence with short duration and almost simultaneous leaf fall with also short duration were mainly found in mixed-forest stands. The longevities of leaves at the basal part of the shoot were short in the species whose bud scales have not entirely differentiated from foliage leaves. The main evolutionary trend in the shoots was suggested to be from homonomous to heteronomous structure and towards the clear distinction between foliage leaves and bud scales.},

Some models predict heights of up to 120\,m in the absence of mechanical damage3,4, but there are historical accounts of taller trees5. Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis6. We studied redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), including the tallest known tree on Earth (112.7\,m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a maximum tree height of 122--130\,m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Background: Undisturbed high elevation treelines follow a common growing season isotherm, irrespective of latitude. Small stature plants thrive at much higher elevations because they grow in a favourable microclimate near the ground, whereas trees are aerodynamically coupled to free atmospheric circulation, hence the uniform treeline elevation in a given region. Aims: I argue that the treeline results from tree architecture and not from a tree-specific inferior physiology. At tissue level, all cold adapted higher plants (including winter crops) face similar temperature related limitations and are constrained by similar thermal thresholds. Methods: In order to explore this hypothesis, winter rape and winter oat were grown in the field and the daily rate of leaf expansion was measured during early winter, with temperatures similar to those at treeline at the beginning of the growing season (monthly mean temperature of 5 {$^\circ$}C). Results: Leaves of these winter crops only grew when the degree hours above 5 {$^\circ$}C for a given day exceeded zero. Rape and oats showed very similar responses. The data support a common temperature threshold for tissue formation in winter crops and treeline trees. Conclusions: A literature survey revealed lower temperature thresholds (close to freezing point) in arctic and Antarctic algae. It appears that the formation of complex, partly lignified tissue does not happen below 5 {$^\circ$}C, whereas such temperatures exert little constraints on photosynthesis. The study illustrates that tissue growth in winter crops can help understand growth of treeline trees, given that both exhibit similar minimum temperature requirements for meristem functioning.}

They do so by developing cold hardiness through deep supercooling, but the mechanistic process of supercooling in buds remains largely unknown. Here we use synchrotron X-ray phase contrast imaging to study cold hardiness-related characteristics of V. amurensis, V. riparia, and V. vinifera buds: time-resolved 2D imaging was used to visualize freezing; and microtomography was used to evaluate morphological changes during deacclimation. Bud cold hardiness was determined (low temperature exotherms; LTEs) using needle thermocouples during 2D imaging as buds were cooled with a N2 gas cryostream. Resolution in 2D imaging did not allow for ice crystal identification, but freezing was assessed by movement of tissues coinciding with LTE values. Freezing was observed to propagate from the center of the bud toward the outer bud scales. The freezing events observed lasted several minutes. Additionally, loss of supercooling ability appears to be correlated with increases in bud tissue volume during the process of deacclimation, but major increases in volume occur after most of the supercooling ability is lost, suggesting growth resumption processes are limited by deacclimation state.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Intraspecific variation plays a critical role in extant and future forest responses to climate change. Forest tree species with wide climatic niches rely on the intraspecific variation resulting from genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to accommodate spatial and temporal climate variability. A centuries-old legacy of forest ecological genetics and provenance trials has provided a strong foundation upon which to continue building on this knowledge, which is critical to maintain climate-adapted forests. Our overall objective is to understand forest trees intraspecific responses to climate across species and biomes, while our specific objectives are to describe ecological genetics models used to build our foundational knowledge, summarize modeling approaches that have expanded the traditional toolset, and extensively review the literature from 1994 to 2021 to highlight the main contributions of this legacy and the new analyzes of provenance trials. We reviewed 103 studies comprising at least three common gardens, which covered 58 forest tree species, 28 of them with range-wide studies. Although studies using provenance trial data cover mostly commercially important forest tree species from temperate and boreal biomes, this synthesis provides a global overview of forest tree species adaptation to climate. We found that evidence for genetic adaptation to local climate is commonly present in the species studied (79\%), being more common in conifers (87.5\%) than in broadleaf species (67\%). In 57\% of the species, clines in fitness-related traits were associated with temperature variables, in 14\% of the species with precipitation, and in 25\% of the species with both. Evidence of adaptation lags was found in 50\% of the species with range-wide studies. We conclude that ecological genetics models and analysis of provenance trial data provide excellent insights on intraspecific genetic variation, whereas the role and limits of phenotypic plasticity, which will likely determine the fate of extant forests, is vastly understudied.},

  abstract = {In boreal forests and alpine treelines, it is debatable how the temperature sensitivity of tree-ring growth should vary with changes in climate over time and the extent to which seasonal stem increments are controlled by leaf physiology. We aim to test the hypothesis that, in cold-limited forests, maximizing stem growth rate around summer solstice is closely related to foliage turnover, which generally results in high sensitivity of stem growth and less sensitivity of nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) to early-season temperatures. Our analysis was based on repeat-census observations of stem radial increment (2008--2013; made with dendrometers) and monthly litterfall (2007--2015) as well as the measurements of tree-ring width series (1960--2015; made with tree-ring cores) in two Tibetan treeline forests. NUE was estimated as the inverse of leaf-litter nitrogen concentration. We further examined a global dataset of tree-ring chronologies (1931--1990) from 139 sites across temperate and boreal coniferous forests in the northern high-latitude region. Weekly stem increments across species and years synchronously peaked around summer solstice, with more than half of annual increment produced in the first 28--35days of the growing season when air and soil temperatures were still low. Monthly stem increments were positively related to previous-month litterfall, and higher litterfall generally resulted in higher NUE. NUE was insensitive or less sensitive to soil temperature in the early growing season. Among years, pre-peak increments were positively correlated with pre-solstice temperatures while post-peak increments varied little. The annual increment was dominated by and coherent with the pre-peak increment and well correlated with the ring-width measurements of monitored trees during 2008--2013. Variations in tree-ring width chronologies from the two Tibetan treelines and the global 139 forest sites mainly reflected the change of early summer temperatures. The findings suggest a day-length control on the linkage between seasonal stem growth and nitrogen cycling in a cold-limited forest ecosystem, and provide the basic for predicting responses of tree-ring growth and NUE to climatic warming.},

However, a higher number of developing tracheids could prolong cell differentiation and, consequently, lengthen the growing season. The relationship between the amount and duration of cell production in the xylem remains an unresolved issue. The aim of this study was to resolve the chicken-or-egg causality dilemma about duration of growth and cell production through simple- and double-cause models. This was achieved by (1) analysing the intra-annual growth dynamics of the xylem in Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP during 2006--2009 in two contrasting sites of the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada, and (2) extracting the dates of onset and ending of xylem formation and the number of radial cells along the tree ring. A higher number of cells was linked to an earlier onset (r = 0.74) and later ending (r = 0.61) of cell differentiation. The absence of a relationship between the residuals of the onset and ending of xylogenesis (rp = -0.06) indicated that cell production influenced the correlation between the two phenophases of the xylem. These results demonstrated that a higher number of cells produced delay the ending of xylem maturation, so extending the duration of wood formation.},

This makes retrospective analyses and modeling of future tree performance difficult. This research investigates the presence, the distinctness, and the periodicity of growth ring for dominant tree species in two semi-deciduous rainforests, which contrast in terms of precipitation dynamics. Eighteen tree species common to both forests were investigated. We used the cambial marking technique and then verified the presence and periodicity of growth-ring boundaries in the wood produced between pinning and collection by microscopic and macroscopic observation. The study showed that all eighteen species can form visible growth rings in both sites. However, the periodicity of ring formation varied significantly within and between species, and within sites. Trees from the site with clearly defined dry season had a higher likelihood to form periodical growth rings compared to those from the site where rainfall seasonality is less pronounced. The distinctness of the formed rings however did not show a site dependency. Periodical growth-ring formation was more likely in fast-growing trees. Furthermore, improvements can be made by a detailed study of the cambial activity through microcores taken at high temporal resolution, to get insight on the phenology of the lateral meristem.},

However, little is known about the relationship between root and shoot phenology, or how this relationship varies among functional traits. We examined fine root and shoot phenology of 42 seedlings representing a variety of woody species that inhabit the cool temperate forests of northern Japan. Some aspects of phenology were common to the pool of species examined: we found positive relationships between root and shoot phenology for the end of growth, and for the duration of growth, but not for the start of growth. Further, seedlings that started root growth relatively early also ended root growth relatively late. Other aspects of phenology varied predictably with functional traits, i.e. leaf habit and successional status: first, root growth in evergreen species started significantly earlier and ended later than in deciduous species; second, early successional species had the longest duration of shoot growth among all successional types. Our results suggest that niche differentiation may be promoted by differences in phenology between root and shoots, likely contributing to the co-existence of woody seedlings in temperate forests.},

  abstract = {Abstract Context: The cerrado stricto sensu is a physiognomy under a seasonal climate of Cerrado vegetation, a Neotropical savanna, showing insignificant light restriction for adult tree species with branches above the herbaceous stratum. Aim: We capture shoot and foliage production in 15 tree Cerrado species with distinct leaf phenology following marked buds to investigate the strategies of air space acquisition and the influence of monthly air temperature and rainfall over a growing season. Methods: Five buds were marked in every five individuals per species during the 2016 dry season in deciduous, semideciduous, and evergreen trees, encompassing five species per leaf habit. Key results: Deciduous trees had plagiotropic shoots with 35º of inclination, while semideciduous and evergreen species had orthotropic (60º) shoots. Evergreen Miconia albicans was the single study species with a second-order shoot, and apical meristem death occurred only in deciduous trees. Two deciduous trees (Caryocar brasiliense and Diospyros hispida) and semideciduous Eriotheca gracilipes increased leaf number per shoot with monthly total precipitation. D. hispida and E. gracilipes also showed a positive correlation between shoot length, monthly air temperature, and monthly precipitation. Conclusions: Only three of the 15 studied species showed a correlation between shoot or foliage production and monthly climate variables during the wet growing season. Deciduous trees avoid foliage self-shading, producing slanting short shoots with leaf flush preceding heavy rains, facilitating rapid branch and foliage formation to offset the leaf-free period quickly. Conversely, evergreen trees, characterized by orthotropic long shoots and slower vegetative growth, rely on foliage self-shading to sustain leaf persistence during seasonal drought. Semideciduous species commonly exhibited shoot and leaf trait variables like those observed on average in deciduous or evergreen trees, resulting in a continuous spectrum of trait variations between the leaf phenological groups. Implications: Each growth strategy in every leaf habit showed a particular air space acquisition across seasons, usually keeping shoot and foliage production independent of monthly climate variability in the wet growing season. These findings emphasize the significance of characterizing the leaf phenological assemblages of the vast Cerrado woody flora as inherent functional groups in a continuum of crown trait variation, enabling the identification of strategies to capture, use, and store resources in each tree group.},

We use multiple satellite and ground-based observations to show that, despite recent climate change during 2001 to 2020, the ratio of time allocated to vegetation green-up over senescence has remained stable [1.27 ({\textpm} 0.92)] across more than 83\% of northern ecosystems. This stability is independent of changes in growing season lengths and is caused by widespread positive relationships among vegetation phenological events; longer vegetation green-up results in longer vegetation senescence. These empirical observations were also partly reproduced by 13 dynamic global vegetation models. Our work demonstrates an intrinsic biotic control to vegetation phenology that could explain the timing of vegetation senescence under climate change.},

  abstract = {Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single-site or single-species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971--2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly) and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade-1 in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days{$^\circ$}C-1, delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day{$^\circ$}C-1). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient r=-0.69, P{$<$}0.001).},

  abstract = {In Citrus, the response to environmental floral inductive signals is inhibited by the presence of developing fruits. The mechanism involves epigenetic activation of the CcMADS19 locus (FLC orthologue), encoding a floral repressor. To understand how this epigenetic regulation is reverted to allow flowering in the following season, we have forced precocious sprouting of axillary buds in fruit-bearing shoots, and examined the competence to floral inductive signals of old and new leaves derived from them. We have found that CcMADS19 is enriched in repressive H3K27me3 marks in young, but not old leaves, revealing that axillary buds retain a silenced version of the floral repressor that is mitotically transmitted to the newly emerging leaves, which are able to induce flowering. Therefore, we propose that flowering in Citrus is necessarily preceded by vegetative sprouting, so that the competence to respond to floral inductive signals is reset in the new leaves.},

  abstract = {The architectural analysis of trees, as developed since the pioneering work of Hall{\'e} \& Oldeman in the 1960s and 1970s, allows the study of the developmental pattern characteristic to each species in a global and dynamic perspective of the tree. This leads to a fundamental question: is there a relationship between architectural characteristics of a species and its successional status? The analysis of nine tree species from the deciduous temperate forest of southwestern Qu{\'e}bec reveals that such a relationship exists, mainly at the level of the alternation of organization plans (hierarchic and polyarchic) during the growth of the trunk and the reiteration within the crown. Early successional species (Betula populifolia and Populus tremuloides) have a hierarchic architecture throughout their ontogenesis. The hierarchy of the branched system promotes a rapid growth of the trunk. The potential for total reiteration in the crown is very limited. Conversely, late successional species (Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia and Tsuga canadensis) have an architecture with several levels of organization. The alternation of hierarchic and polyarchic phases of development confers a greater shape plasticity upon the tree, to the detriment of the speed of growth of the trunk. However, reiteration within the crown is common and abundant. This process increases the lateral spread of the crown, as well as it prolongs the life span of the tree itself. Mid-successional species (Ulmus americana, Fraxinus americana, Tilia americana and Carya cordiformis) have architectural development in between these two extremes. They combine a great hierarchy in the structure of the young tree with a potential for reiteration in the crown. Two growth strategies were identified among the late successional species, one facilitating growth in the shade and the other allowing the tree to benefit from increase in light in canopy gaps.},

  abstract = {Alpine plants have evolved a tight seasonal cycle of growth and senescence to cope with a short growing season. The potential growing season length (GSL) is increasing because of climate warming, possibly prolonging plant growth above- and belowground. We tested whether growth dynamics in typical alpine grassland are altered when the natural GSL (2--3 months) is experimentally advanced and thus, prolonged by 2--4 months. Additional summer months did not extend the growing period, as canopy browning started 34--41 days after the start of the season, even when GSL was more than doubled. Less than 10\% of roots were produced during the added months, suggesting that root growth was as conservative as leaf growth. Few species showed a weak second greening under prolonged GSL, but not the dominant sedge. A longer growing season under future climate may therefore not extend growth in this widespread alpine community, but will foster species that follow a less strict phenology.},

Global patterns of high-temperature tolerance are documented in animals, but generally not in plants, limiting our ability to assess risks associated with climate warming. To assess whether there are global patterns in high-temperature tolerance of leaf metabolism, we quantified Tcrit (high temperature where minimal chlorophyll a fluorescence rises rapidly and thus photosystem II is disrupted) and Tmax (temperature where leaf respiration in darkness is maximal, beyond which respiratory function rapidly declines) in upper canopy leaves of 218 plant species spanning seven biomes. Mean site-based Tcrit values ranged from 41.5 {$^\circ$}C in the Alaskan arctic to 50.8 {$^\circ$}C in lowland tropical rainforests of Peruvian Amazon. For Tmax, the equivalent values were 51.0 and 60.6 {$^\circ$}C in the Arctic and Amazon, respectively. Tcrit and Tmax followed similar biogeographic patterns, increasing linearly ({\texttildelow}8 {$^\circ$}C) from polar to equatorial regions. Such increases in high-temperature tolerance are much less than expected based on the 20 {$^\circ$}C span in high-temperature extremes across the globe. Moreover, with only modest high-temperature tolerance despite high summer temperature extremes, species in mid-latitude ( 20--50{$^\circ$}) regions have the narrowest thermal safety margins in upper canopy leaves; these regions are at the greatest risk of damage due to extreme heat-wave events, especially under conditions when leaf temperatures are further elevated by a lack of transpirational cooling. Using predicted heat-wave events for 2050 and accounting for possible thermal acclimation of Tcrit and Tmax, we also found that these safety margins could shrink in a warmer world, as rising temperatures are likely to exceed thermal tolerance limits. Thus, increasing numbers of species in many biomes may be at risk as heat-wave events become more severe with climate change.},

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Fagus sylvatica (Beech) is a large usually single-stemmed deciduous tree native to south-east England but now growing over almost the whole of the British Isles, often planted as a forestry tree on all but the wettest soils. It forms extensive woodlands, where it is dominant over a large altitudinal range, competing primarily with Quercus robur. The outcome of this competition is determined by local soil and climatic conditions leading to a gradation into oak woodlands. It is monoecious, wind-pollinated and notable for its periodic large seed numbers (mast years); seed is dispersed by birds and mammals but mostly drops below the parent tree. Fagus sylvatica is hardy, very shade tolerant, casts a deep shade and is fairly resistant to browsing but susceptible to spring frosts. Due to its shallow rooting and intensive rather than extensive mode of soil water exploitation, it is also susceptible to drought, and this is likely to be the main factor controlling its expected response to climate change. Fagus sylvatica is facing few conservation problems, and indeed, its range is currently expanding into central Europe. However, in the face of climate change, its range is likely to contract from its extremes in all but the north, and Phytophthora diseases may become more serious.},

  abstract = {The development of the trunk and main branches of approximately 26-year-old Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp. et Endl.) Krasser trees was studied. The length and number of leaves of annual shoots were recorded for 56 trees from a natural population. Morphological and macroanatomical features allowed the identification of shoot apex deaths and the axillary positions from which branches and relay shoots derived. The trees had a mean height of approximately 6 m and a mean basal diameter of approximately 8 cm. The length of trunk shoots increased from the first years to the intermediate years of tree growth and decreased for the last 6 years of tree growth. The maximum length and number of leaves of trunk shoots were registered for the years around 1985, when tree age was about 17 years. The likelihood of apex death for trunk shoots was minimum for the period of maximum trunk shoot size. Despite the fact that the architectural features of the sampled trees corresponded to those of young, vigorously growing trees, they seemed to have reached a stage of low annual height growth. A sharp decrease in trunk shoot size occurred in 1992, a year in which rainfall during the growing season reached the minimum for the lifetime of the sampled trees. The size of shoots developed after 1992 was, on average, lower than that of shoots developed before 1992. Stressful conditions in this year may relate to meristem ageing and thus to the size of shoots formed in the following years. Main branches started their development with shoots similar to those of the trunk but were clearly differentiated from the trunk 5 years later. The differentiation between main branch and trunk shoots involved not only a lower shoot size but also a higher number of leaves per shoot length unit in main branch than in trunk shoots.Key words: Nothofagus pumilio, architectural analysis, shoot, trunk development, branching pattern, morphogenetic gradient.},

The positive relationship between the size of a shoot and that of its parent shoot was stronger for proximal than for distal positions on the parent shoots. For each bud position on the parent shoots there were differences in the number of leaf primordia per bud between consecutive years. The correlations between the number of leaf primordia per bud and bud size, bud position and parent shoot size varied between years. Only shoots produced close to the distal end of a parent shoot developed neoformed leaves; more proximal sibling shoots consisted entirely of preformed leaves. Leaf neoformation, a process usually linked with high shoot vigour in woody plants, seems to be widespread among the relatively small shoots developed in N. antarctica shrubs, which may relate to the species' opportunistic response to disturbance.},

  abstract = {Plant phenology is one of the strongest indicators of ecological responses to climate change, and altered phenology can have pronounced effects on net primary production, species composition in local communities, greenhouse gas fluxes, and ecosystem processes. Although many studies have shown that aboveground plant phenology advances with warmer temperatures, demonstration of a comparable association for belowground phenology has been lacking because the factors that influence root phenology are poorly understood. Because roots can constitute a large fraction of plant biomass, and root phenology may not respond to warming in the same way as shoots, this represents an important knowledge gap in our understanding of how climate change will influence phenology and plant performance. We review studies of root phenology and provide suggestions to direct future research. Only 29\% of examined studies approached root phenology quantitatively, strongly limiting interpretation of results across studies. Therefore, we suggest that researchers emphasize quantitative analyses in future phenological studies. We suggest that root initiation, peak growth, and root cessation may be under different controls. Root initiation and cessation may be more constrained by soil temperature and the timing of carbon availability, whereas the timing of peak root growth may represent trade-offs among competing plant sinks. Roots probably do not experience winter dormancy in the same way as shoots: 89\% of the studies that examined winter phenology found evidence of growth during winter months. More research is needed to observe root phenology, and future studies should be careful to capture winter and early season phenology. This should be done quantitatively, with direct observations of root growth utilizing rhizotrons or minirhizotrons.},

Western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) is a deciduous conifer species undergoing assisted migration beyond its natural range in British Columbia into areas that have become suitable based on climatic niche modelling. We established a seedling common garden experiment in raised beds in a warm location outside the natural range for three growing seasons, with 52 natural populations from across the species range and 28 selectively bred families from British Columbia. Intraspecific genetic variation in growth, phenology and cold hardiness was analyzed to test for signals of local adaptation and the effects of selective breeding to better understand the implications for assisted migration and breeding for future climates. We found weak differentiation among populations in all traits, with the proportion of additive genetic variance (QST) ranging from 0.10 to 0.28. Cold hardiness had the weakest population differentiation and exhibited no clines with geographic or climatic variables. Selective breeding for faster growth has maintained genetic variation in bud flush phenology and cold hardiness despite delaying bud set. The weak signals of local adaptation we found in western larch seedlings highlights that assisted gene flow among populations is likely to have limited benefits and risks for mitigating maladaptation with climate change. Our findings suggest that assisted migration outside of the range and selective breeding may be important management strategies for western larch for future climates.},

Location Ten European and Canadian sites at different latitudes and altitudes. Methods The periods of cambial activity and cell differentiation were assessed on a weekly time-scale on histological sections of cambium and wood tissue collected over 2 to 5 years per site from 1998 to 2005 from the stems of seven conifer species. All data were compared with daily air temperatures recorded from weather stations located close to the sites. Logistic regressions were used to calculate the probability of xylogenesis and of cambium being active at a given temperature. Results Xylogenesis lasted from May to October, with a growing period varying from 3 to 5 months depending on location and elevation. Despite the wide geographical range of the monitored sites, temperatures for onset and ending of xylogenesis converged towards narrow ranges with average values around 4-5, 8-9 and 13-14 degrees C for daily minimum, mean and maximum temperature, respectively. On the contrary, cell division in the cambium stopped in July-August, when temperatures were still high. Main conclusions Wood formation in conifers occurred when specific critical temperatures were reached. Although the timing and duration of xylogenesis varied among species, sites and years, the estimated temperatures were stable for all trees studied. These results provide biologically based evidence that temperature is a critical factor limiting production and differentiation of xylem cells in cold climates. Although daily temperatures below 4-5 degrees C are still favourable for photosynthesis, thermal conditions below these values could inhibit the allocation of assimilated carbon to structural investment, i.e. xylem growth.}

The frequency of occurrence of lammas growth, prolepsis, and combinations of both varied between seed sources in the six plantations studied, indicating thatthe tendency to form these shoots is under genetic control. Regression analysis showed that, with few exceptions, the frequency of late shoot types increases predictably with more southerly latitude of seed origin, with an increase in degree days over 50{$^\circ$} F of the origin, and with higheraverage July temperature of the origin. The variation in late shoot occurrence between sources showed a clinal or continuous pattern indicating that formation of lammas and proleptic shoots is controlled by more than a single pair of genes, or that there is a gradual change in the frequencyof one or a few genes in the population sampled in the study. Extension of the photoperiod caused a marked increase in the frequency of lammas and proleptic shoot formation. Trees with lammas growth had a longer height growth period than those with normal growth, their growth period was furtherextended by long-day conditions, and they showed a different seasonal growth pattern as well as greater annual height growth than normal trees. Trees with lammas growth did not grow significantly less the following season than those with normal growth the previous season. Lammas growth andprolepsis did not result in detectable false rings. Deviations from normal shoot development and tree form resulting from lammas growth and prolepsis depended upon the type of late-shoot development and on its magnitude. These and more detailed results are presented and discussed in termsof the stated objectives.},

Here, we identified the minimum temperatures for root growth in seven broad-leaved tree species, compared them with the species' natural elevational limits and identified morphological changes in roots produced near their physiological cold limit. Seedlings were exposed to a vertical soil-temperature gradient from 20 to 2\>{$^\circ$}C along the rooting zone for 18\>weeks. In all species, the bulk of roots was produced at temperatures above 5\>{$^\circ$}C. However, the absolute minimum temperatures for root growth differed among species between 2.3 and 4.2\>{$^\circ$}C, with those species that reach their natural distribution limits at higher elevations also tending to have lower thermal limits for root tissue formation. In all investigated species, the roots produced at temperatures close to the thermal limit were pale, thick, unbranched and of reduced mechanical strength. Across species, the specific root length (m\>g-1 root) was reduced by, on average, 60\% at temperatures below 7\>{$^\circ$}C. A significant correlation of minimum temperatures for root growth with the natural high elevation limits of the investigated species indicates species-specific thermal requirements for basic physiological processes. Although these limits are not necessarily directly causative for the upper distribution limit of a species, they seem to belong to a syndrome of adaptive processes for life at low temperatures. The anatomical changes at the cold limit likely hint at the mechanisms impeding meristematic activity at low temperatures.},

Here, we explore the use of two potential techniques for nutrient loading of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings: (1) exponential fertilization and (2) early shoot growth termination in order to divert assimilated nutrients and carbon to storage rather than to growth. In the first study, aspen seedlings were treated with either exponential or constant fertilization rates, both of which supplied the same amount of nutrients over the growing season. Exponential fertilization resulted in overall poor planting stock form (stunted seedling growth and weak root development) and produced only marginal improvements of nutrient status. As a result, the exponential fertilization regime studied cannot be recommended as a treatment for aspen seedlings. In the second study we treated seedlings with a 2~{\texttimes}~2 factorial combination of fertilization and shoot growth inhibitor (SGI) applications with the fertilizer treatments varying in terms of mid-season fertilizer concentrations. Seedlings with SGI application had much higher tissue nutrient and carbon reserve concentrations than seedlings without a SGI application. In addition, nutrient uptake appeared to be more efficient in SGI treated seedlings, which could potentially result in significant reductions of nutrient application rates during aspen seedling production in nurseries. Overall, early shoot growth termination using a SGI appears to be an effective technique to produce nutrient loaded aspen seedlings.},

The species chosen for this study were Anadenanthera falcata, Stryphnodendron adstringens, Stryphnodendron polyphyllum, and Tabebuia aurea. Seeds were dissected to evaluate: the lengths of the hypocotyl-radicular axis, the epicotyl and the embryonic axis, mass of the cotyledons and the embryonic axis, and eophyll number (preformed organs). Another group of seeds was germinated in a greenhouse for sixty days to verify the emergence of the epicotyl, eophylls, metaphylls, and to measure seedling biomass. Only A. falcata presented a plumule with differentiated eophylls. Anadenanthera falcata germinated before the other species in the greenhouse and had faster epicotyl and leaf emergence. Possibly, the presence of eophylls inside the seed enabled A. falcata seedlings to carry out photosynthesis, grow faster, and accumulate more aerial biomass than the other species soon after emergence. The presence of eophylls in a differentiated embryo (as in A. falcata) may hasten germination and favour seedling establishment.},

  abstract = {Plant phenology is expected to be sensitive to climate warming. In boreal trees, spring flush is primarily temperature driven, whereas height growth cessation and autumn leaf senescence are predominantly controlled by photoperiod. Cuttings of 525 genotypes from the full range of balsam poplar were planted into two common gardens (Vancouver and Indian Head, Canada) at similar latitudes, but with differing winter temperatures and growing seasons. There was clinal variation in spring and, particularly, summer and fall phenology. Bud flush and, despite milder climate, bud set and leaf drop were earlier at Vancouver than at Indian Head by 44, 28 and 7 d, respectively. Although newly flushed growth is insensitive to photoperiod, many genotypes at both sites became competent before the summer solstice. At Vancouver, high-latitude genotypes set dormant terminal buds in mid-spring. Most other genotypes grew until midsummer or set bud temporarily and then experienced a second flush. In both gardens and in a growth chamber experiment, earlier bud set was associated with reduced height growth and higher root/shoot ratios. Shoots attained competency {$\sim$}5 weeks after flushing, which would normally prevent dormancy induction before the solstice, but may be insufficient if spring advances by more than a few weeks.},

  abstract = {The onset of spring growth and vessel formation were examined within three deciduous woody plant species, Acer rubrum, Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa and Quercus rubra. We were broadly interested in the lag between the onset of girth expansion and the formation of mature and hydraulically conductive vessels within the new xylem.Dendrometers were installed on 20 trees (6--7 per species), and expansion of both bole and distal stems was monitored throughout the growing season in a common garden. For each species, four to six distal stems were harvested every other week for anatomical examination of vessel formation. Additionally, for Populus and Quercus, hydraulic conductivity measurements and active xylem staining were completed on all stem samples.For all three species, the timing of girth expansion was similar. Expansion of distal branches occurred 12--37 d earlier than that of the bole. Vessel formation initiated several weeks prior to leaf-out, but no new earlywood vessels were mature at the time of bud break for Acer and Populus and only a few were present in Quercus. Initial stem girth expansion occurred 2 to \&gt;6 weeks before the maturation of the first current-year vessels, and there was an additional delay of up to 4 weeks before mature vessels became hydraulically functional. Hydraulic conductivity was strongly correlated with the number and diameter of stained vessels.Bud break and leaf expansion relied predominantly on water supplied by vessels formed during prior seasons. Early-season activity is likely affected by the function of older xylem vessels and the environmental factors that influence their structure and function. Understanding the functional lifespan of vessels and the varying contributions of new and older vessels to conductivity are critical to understanding of the phenology and vascular function of long-lived woody plants in response to changing climates.},

  abstract = {Two strategies have evolved in understory trees in relation to light availability: maximization of light capture and shade tolerance. In the genus Acer, light capture is favored by a suite of traits maximizing twig thickness and leaf size and minimizing the density of branching in the crown. In contrast, shade tolerance is enhanced by minimizing crown area, crown volume, and total leaf area per unit height. Maples with polycyclic shoot growth (i.e., successive flushes of shoot growth separated by a resting phase within the same vegetative period) may benefit from the prolonged growth by growing more and increasing total leaf area; thus we hypothesize that polycyclism is evolutionarily correlated with the suite of traits related to light capture. We tested this hypothesis using different phylogenetic trees to explore correlations between polycyclism and both suites of traits. Polycyclism was correlated with the suite of traits maximizing light capture, suggesting that polycyclic maples are ``optimists'' (i.e., they make vigorous vertical extensions in rich light) and monocyclic maples are ``pessimists'' (i.e., they wait in the dark understory until a gap is opened). Both strategies have been described for different floras, and interestingly, polycyclic species recruit over a wider range of environments than the monocyclic species.},

By using a mutant with defects in photoperiodic growth, we identified a seasonal growth regulation pathway that functions in long days in parallel to the canonical long-day photoperiod flowering mechanism. This is achieved by using distinct mechanisms to detect different photoperiods: The flowering pathway measures photoperiod as the duration of light intensity, whereas the growth pathway measures photoperiod as the duration of photosynthetic activity (photosynthetic period). Plants can then independently control expression of genes required for flowering or growth. This demonstrates that seasonal flowering and growth are dissociable, allowing them to be coordinated independently across seasons.},

Bayesian models are especially adept at this and are growing in use in ecology. Yet many ecologists today are not trained to take advantage of the bigger ecological data needed to generate more flexible robust models. Here we describe a broadly generalizable workflow for statistical analyses and show how it can enhance training in ecology. Building on the increasingly computational toolkit of many ecologists, this approach leverages simulation to integrate model building and testing for empirical data more fully with ecological theory. In turn this workflow can fit models that are more robust and well-suited to provide new ecological insights -- allowing us to refine where to put resources for better estimates, better models, and better forecasts.},

The response of these architectural components to two sharply contrasting environments was examined in two replicated plantations containing a cloned interspecific hybrid pedigree of Populus trichocarpa and P. deltoides that included the original parents, two F1 parents, and 375 F2 genotypes. In the warmer, sunnier, and better-watered environment of interior Boardman, Oregon, 2-year-old trees produced more, larger, and wider leaves, as well as more and longer branches, than in the cooler and more cloudy coastal conditions of Clatskanie, Oregon. Sylleptic branches were phenotypically more plastic than the other elements of the crown. Most trees produced significantly more and longer sylleptics in the near-optimal growth environment in Boardman than in the suboptimal environment of Clatskanie. In both environments, all crown traits displayed significant genotype effects in the F2 family, but for most traits, broad-sense heritabilities were statistically larger in Clatskanie (0.44--0.78) than Boardman (0.28--0.70). For all traits except for the number of sylleptics, the values of across-environment genetic correlations were significantly larger than zero but less than one, indicating that nonparallel responses of genotypes to environment had led to significant genotype{\texttimes}environment interactions, although some genetic basis was shared between the two environments. A nonsignificant genetic correlation of sylleptic number expressed in the two different environments suggests that the phenotypic plasticity of this trait is under strong genetic control. All architectural traits, except for branch and canopy traits of sylleptics, were correlated with growth more strongly in Clatskanie than Boardman. In both environments, contrary to observations in an earlier study, proleptic traits were better predictors of stem height and basal area growth than sylleptic traits.},

Accounting for this effect improved the accuracy of senescence predictions by 27 to 42\% and reversed future predictions from a previously expected 2- to 3-week delay over the rest of the century to an advance of 3 to 6 days. These findings demonstrate the critical role of sink limitation in governing the end of seasonal activity and reveal important constraints on future growing-season lengths and carbon uptake of trees.},

In several cases, however, the advancing has levelled off, indicating a declining temperature sensitivity of phenological timing. The po\- tential reasons for the decline have been actively debated, but no direct experimental evidence has been pro\- duced to support any of the theories put forward. With the aid of scenario simulations, we examined which ecophysiological tree traits restrict the advancing of the onset of spring phenology in four subtropical tree species under global warming. In the simulations, we applied process-based tree spring phenology models formulated on the basis of results of experiments specifically designed for examining the ecophysiological responses addressed. We identified three restricting ecophysiological traits: 1) the chilling effect operates at relatively low tempera\- tures only, 2) the temperature sensitivity of spring phenology is low in the temperature range of +10 to +20 {\textopenbullet}C which is critical under climatic warming in subtropical conditions; and 3) the winter rest is deep. Unexpectedly, a high chilling requirement was not included amongst the restricting ecophysiological traits. Our experimentallybased results show that the spring phenology of the trees under climatic warming is significantly affected by seemingly small and usually neglected details of the ecophysiological responses to chilling and forcing temperatures.},

Compared to traditional methods of forests monitoring which mostly use orthophotography from satellites or aircraft, there is very little research on the use of 3D canopy structure to monitor forest growth. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial could be a novel and feasible platform to generate more timely and high resolution forest 3D canopy images. In spring, the forest is supposed to experience rapid growth. In this research, we used a small UAV to monitor campus forest growth in spring at 2-day intervals. Each time, 140 images were acquired and the ground surface dense point cloud was reconstructed at high precision. Excess Green indexes (ExG) was used to extract the green canopy points. The segmented point cloud was triangulated using the greedy projection triangulation method into a mesh and its area was calculated. Forest canopy growth was analyzed at three levels: forest level, selected group level and individual tree level. A logistic curve was used to fit the time series canopy growth. Strong correlation was found R2 = 0.8517 at forest level, R2 = 0.9652 at selected group level and R2 = 0.9606 at individual tree level. Moreover, high correlation was found between canopies. By observing these results, we can conclude that the ground 3D model can act as a useful data type to monitor forest growth. Moreover UAV aerial remote sensing has advantages when monitoring forests in periods when the ground vegetation is growing and changing fast.},

The occurrence of lammas growth extends the growing season of trees, but its influence on subsequent dormancy phenomena and bud burst phenology remains largely unexplored. By comparing seedlings showing lammas growth with others not showing it, we carried out an experimental study of how lammas growth affects the bud burst phenology and the underlying dormancy phenomena under both ambient and controlled chilling, forcing and warming conditions in four subtropical tree species: Carya illinoinensis, Cinnamomum japonicum, Phoebe chekiangensis and Torreya grandis. With the exception of C. illinoinensis, lammas growth delayed bud burst in all the species under ambient conditions. In the chilling experiment, the delayed bud burst appeared to be due to higher minimum forcing requirement, higher dormancy depth, and in T. grandis, also due to lower chilling sensitivity in the lammas-growth seedlings than in the non-lammas-growth ones. However, a spring warming experiment showed that the sensitivity of bud burst to spring temperatures was higher in the lammas-growth seedlings than in the non-lammas-growth ones. Because of this, the difference between the two phenotypes in the timing of bud burst vanished with increasing warming. Our findings elucidate the significant impact of lammas growth on the dormancy dynamics of subtropical tree species, highlighting the necessity to better understand how the physiological phenomena causing lammas growth change the trees' subsequent environmental responses under changing climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {Climate change is shifting the growing seasons of plants, affecting species performance and biogeochemical cycles. Yet how the timing of autumn leaf senescence in Northern Hemisphere forests will change remains uncertain. Using satellite, ground, carbon flux, and experimental data, we show that early-season and late-season warming have opposite effects on leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring after the year's longest day (the summer solstice). Across 84\% of the northern forest area, increased temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence onset of, on average, 1.9 {\textpm} 0.1 days per {$^\circ$}C, whereas warmer post-solstice temperatures extended senescence duration by 2.6 {\textpm} 0.1 days per {$^\circ$}C. The current trajectories toward an earlier onset and slowed progression of senescence affect Northern Hemisphere--wide trends in growing-season length and forest productivity.},

  abstract = {Earlier leaf-out and later autumn leaf senescence under climate warming have been linked to increases in plant productivity and ecosystem carbon uptake. Yet, despite the potential implications of shifting phenology for plant carbon uptake, the degree to which phenological changes affect overall plant growth and the partitioning between above- and below-ground biomass remains unclear. Here we use a 3-year experiment to quantify changes in root and shoot growth of three woody plant species (two common European tree species, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, and one shrub Lonicera xylosteum) under spring and autumn warming. In both tree species, the magnitude---and in Quercus even the direction---of the effects of growing-season length on growth depends on whether the warming happened in spring or in autumn. Each day earlier leaf-out in response to warming resulted in total biomass increases of 0.8\%--2.5\%, whereas delayed senescence led to reductions of 0.2\%--2.1\%. Advances in leaf-out also led to increased root-to-shoot biomass ratios because root growth was proportionally more stimulated than shoot growth. In the shrub species, earlier leaf-out had no effect, while delayed senescence led to increases in root, but not shoot, biomass. Synthesis. The strong asymmetry between growth responses to spring versus autumn phenology demonstrates that growing-season length per se is a weak indicator of individual-level tree productivity. The results further imply that phenological shifts are reshaping the functional balance between above- and below-ground growth, which is critical for quantifying forest carbon dynamics under climate change.},

  abstract = {Late-spring frosts (LSFs) affect the performance of plants and animals across the world's temperate and boreal zones, but despite their ecological and economic impact on agriculture and forestry, the geographic distribution and evolutionary impact of these frost events are poorly understood. Here, we analyze LSFs between 1959 and 2017 and the resistance strategies of Northern Hemisphere woody species to infer trees' adaptations for minimizing frost damage to their leaves and to forecast forest vulnerability under the ongoing changes in frost frequencies. Trait values on leaf-out and leaf-freezing resistance come from up to 1,500 temperate and boreal woody species cultivated in common gardens. We find that areas in which LSFs are common, such as eastern North America, harbor tree species with cautious (late-leafing) leaf-out strategies. Areas in which LSFs used to be unlikely, such as broad-leaved forests and shrublands in Europe and Asia, instead harbor opportunistic tree species (quickly reacting to warming air temperatures). LSFs in the latter regions are currently increasing, and given species' innate resistance strategies, we estimate that similar to 35\% of the European and similar to 26\% of the Asian temperate forest area, but only similar to 10\% of the North American, will experience increasing late-frost damage in the future. Our findings reveal region-specific changes in the spring-frost risk that can inform decision-making in land management, forestry, agriculture, and insurance policy.},
