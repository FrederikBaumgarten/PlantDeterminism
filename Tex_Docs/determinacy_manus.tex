\section*{Abstract} %150 words 
	When and how much organisms grow given environmental and other constraints are fundamental questions in biology. For plants their answers are more pressing than ever to predict biomass production and carbon sequestration in the current and future climate. Increasingly, research has uncovered the relationships between environmental drivers and plant growth, particularly the physiological effects of temperature and moisture extremes. Yet this research has also highlighted that environmental conditions are not enough to predict when a plant is growing. An often-overlooked factor appears to be the phenological sequence---the developmental stages and transitions set by the genetic programming of a plant that manifests in species-specific growth patterns. This internal schedule may be critical to predicting responses to climate change, but rarely discussed. 
	
	Here, we leverage the concept of (in-)determinism---which captures how flexible, or not, plants are in preforming and committing tissue to growth over time---to propose a new framework for predicting tree responses to climate change. We propose that: 1) determinate growth (expansion of preformed tissue) is an adaptation to predictable climates by temporally escaping from critically stressful periods. These species concentrate their primary growth between last spring frost events and water limitations in summer with ample safety margins. 2) With climate change introducing more frequent, extreme, and irregular stress conditions, species capable of forming new tissue throughout the growing season (indeterminate growth) may recover and compensate from damage more effectively. 3) Additionally, the higher the degree of indeterminacy in a species, the greater its capacity to benefit from extended growing seasons. 
	
	Consequently, the amount of carbon sequestered in future climates may depend not only on abiotic factors such as water availability, temperature extremes, and the length of the growing season, but also on the degree of determinacy set by a species' intrinsic genetic programming.\\

\section*{Introduction}
%emwJun8 -- remove the subsections from intro? They seem too short to be needed and an intro should get the reader to the exciting points quickly, especially in a perspective. 
	

		Investing the right amount of resources at the right time is of crucial importance to the survival and fitness of any living organism. In tropical ecosystems a continued production of tissue can be both possible and advantageous, in all other regions, however, strategies that rely on growth from stored reserves and pre-build tissue are widely common. %The rapid canopy formation of deciduous trees in spring of temperate forests is such an example. However, canopy duration is a poor predictor of when growth and therefore carbon sequestration occur

	\subsection*{Seasonality of temperature and soil moisture}
		The further one travels from the equator towards the poles, the tighter plants are confined to a shrinking ‘time window of opportunity’ set primarily by low temperatures. Below c. 5°C  metabolic activity slows down to an extend where growth and development comes to a halt \citep{schenkerPhysiologicalMinimumTemperatures2014, rossiCriticalTemperaturesXylogenesis2008, kornerWinterCropGrowth2008}. More importantly, freezing temperatures can cause severe damages to plant tissue if exposed at the wrong time of development, e.g. after leaf unfolding or prior to fruit maturation \citep{sakaiFreezingInjuriesPlants1987c, baumgartenNoRiskNo2023a}. %emwJun8 -- I would additionally cite Satake and Larcher or something older here, as this is not a new idea.  
		While annual plant species accommodate their entire life cycle within this window, perennial plants are forced to split their growing phase into annual chunks with periods of activity alternating with a period of rest (dormancy). This is referred to as intermittent or rhythmic (as opposed to continuous) growth. \\


During the active growing season high temperatures can directly reduce plant activity and development, preventing any new growth when species-specific thresholds are exceeded \citep{osullivanThermalLimitsLeaf2017}. High temperatures can also indirectly reduce or stall growth through decreasing soil moisture and thus increasing plant water stress (CITES; it would be great to get some diversified references too -- any ideas for some classics? Stearns life history book?). Together, these temperature and soil moisture limitations act as 'environmental filters', narrowing the window of opportunity where potential growth could happen.

%High temperatures increase the evaporative demand of plants which in turn decreases the water status (water potential) along the entire root-to-shoot-continuum. Trees are able to lift water to great heights, but meristems are not able to divide cells under too low cell pressure (turgor), which explains the physical limits to tree height \citep{kochLimitsTreeHeight2004} and why trees mainly grow at night, when transpiration stops and cell turgor relaxes \citep{zweifelWhyTreesGrow2021}. Of course meristematic activity completely ceases under limited soil water availability --- a major reason why trees in many regions grow only  a fraction of days within the potential thermal growing season \citep{etzoldNumberGrowthDays2021}. Figure \ref{fig:fig_1xxx} shows these temperature and soil moisture limitations as 'environmental filters', narrowing the window of opportunity where potential growth could happen. \\
		
		\subsection*{Internal programming of plants}
		Given our developed physiological understanding on how growth is controlled by environmental factors, namely temperature and soil moisture availability, one could think that predictions about when and how much trees are growing in a current and future climate should be fairly simple to make. However, this is not the case, in particular for predictions with extended climatic growing seasons \citep{zohnerHowChangesSpring2021}. It seems that environmental variables alone are not sufficient to capture the dynamic and extend of biomass production and therefore carbon sequestration.  Here we propose the framework for an additional factor to consider: internal growth control - the genetically fixed developmental program that can dictate not to grow \textit{despite} favourable environmental conditions.\\
		
		%emwJun8 -- love the idea of 'escaping' these conditions -- nice verb choice! Would be great to shorten previous paragraph and get the reader here sooner. 
		While plants have evolved many mechanisms to tolerate or avoid such potentially harmful conditions by specialized morphological adaptations, most species, even in the tropics, cope with fluctuating temperature and moisture regimes by temporally escaping these conditions. This involves the progression of a dormancy cycle and the timing of life history events (phenology) during favourable `growing season' conditions, and ultimately phenological sequences that optimally balance growth and reproduction with survival for long-lived organisms. These sequences can impose abrupt switches in resource allocation from vegetative growth to reproduction (flowering, fruit maturation) and storage (REF, Figure \ref{fig:fig_1xxx} that act as internal filters to narrow the window in which growth can occur.\\

Environmental factors like temperature and soil moisture, exceeding growth-promoting thresholds can be seen as filters that narrow the window of opportunity available for vegetative growth. The species-specific life history cycle (phenology) can further impose another filter by imposing a dormancy cycle and prioritizing developmental processes other than vegetative growth (e.g. flowering, fruit maturation and storage). }

\section*{The concept of (in)determinate growth}
The topic of growth strategies and habits has a long history in science, spanning the fields of genomics, physiology and ecology across the animal and plant kingdoms. At its core lays the concept of determinacy---the classification of organisms to either reach a fixed size with adulthood or to continue to grow throughout their lifetime. Like mollusks, fish and reptiles, plants add to their primary bodies as long as they live and are therefore considered 'indeterminate growers' \citep{ejsmondHowTimeGrowth2010}. Various terms emerged to describe this fundamental phenomenon at different spacial and temporal scales, e.g. from a cell to an organism and from a season to a whole lifetime \citep{mcdanielInductionDeterminationDevelopmental1992a, karkachTrajectoriesModelsIndividual2006}. \\

In annual plants, growth ends with the production of flowers to form fruits and seeds: a signal in the apical meristem causes a sudden switch in resource investment from vegetative growth to building a reproductive structure with no point of return, ringing in the end of its life-cycle. In contrast, most perennial plant species and trees in particular, build flowers on lateral buds to enable the seasonal production of offsprings while the vegetative structure keeps expanding. \\

Within one growing season, however, trees exhibit a strategy of determinacy (see Figure \ref{fig:fig_2xxx}): Commonly, trees prebuild their new shoot increments in the previous year, overwintering in hardened buds to be 'ready to go' when spring arrives. Once the (additional) canopy is unfolded within a few days to weeks some species suspend their primary growth activity by hormonal suppression of the apical meristems for the rest of the season.  \citep[paradormancy,][]{langEndoParaEcodormancy1987}.  Other species, however, continue to produce new tissue ontop/beyond of the preformed one, in some cases stretching their growth period far into autumn until low temperature force them to stop. In essence, determinacy in trees refers to the ability to:\\
a) preform tissue as a future investment that is ready to be deployed in spring with no further primary growth thereafter (determinate strategy)\\
b) maintain a somewhat constant growth activity (or activity bursts) by forming new tissue during the current growing season (indeterminate strategy)\\

While this concept is often presented as dichotomous (\cite{kozlowskiGrowthControlWoody1997, lechowiczWhyTemperateDeciduous1984a}, but see \citet{kikuzawaLeafSurvivalWoody1983, damascosBudCompositionBranching2005}), with species exhibiting either one extreme or the other, they more likely exist along a gradient with numerous intermediate forms. For example many oak species considered determinate growers, exhibit a second flush and many species gradually become more determinate as they mature \citep{borchertConceptJuvenilityWoody1976, heuretOntogeneticTrendsMorphological2006}.

Commonly all tree species deploy buds during their first spring flush from prebuild and overwintering leaf primordia (A). Determinate growing species set bud (B) that are under hormonal suppression to sustain any further activity of the shoot apical meristem (paradormancy). Indeterminate growing species continue to produce new tissue directly (C) or through one (D) to several (E) intermediate bud stage(s). Finally all species set their bud (F) and enter full dormancy (endodormancy). Shoot apical meristem (SAM); Bud scale (BS); leaf primordia (LP). The basic unit of a shoot is the phytomer which is composed of a node, a leaf, the axillary bud and an internode.}

\section*{Control mechanisms/What controls/drivers of determinism}
%emwJun8 -- fix quote marks before sending on to coauthors: https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/QuotDash.html -- I fixed a couple below, but most of the open quotes are wrong. 
Although a century of studying growth habits has passed we still have very little understanding of when and why trees exhibit a certain degree of (in)determinsm in their growth strategy. To a large extent this is probably due to the variable environmental conditions within and between years as well as among sites and individuals that complicates the separation of factors influencing or driving shoot elongation and for that matter other meristematic activity.

%emwJun8 -- I continue to not see the utility of trying to explain this R:S angle in an article already introducing a lot of points. I think you will alienate readers.
Indeed there is some evidence that under favorable conditions, particularly high soil moisture availability, stretching into the growing season prolongs the period of shoot elongation or permitting a second flush, also known as lammas growth or "Johannitrieb" (see Figure \ref{fig:fig_2xxx}). This indicates that shoot growth may come to a halt because the demand for water to support greater leaf area cannot be met. Since above and below-ground meristem experience large differences in temperature, the higher growth rate of shoots may soon result in an imbalanced root-shoot-ratio that can only be overcome by sustaining growth of the apical meristems until root growth has caught up to reach the supply capacity. A high evapotranspiration or a drying soil might have the same effect. Such a `stop-and-go' behavior of the apical meristem as a  consequence of lower growth rates in roots could explain the poly-cyclic flushing patterns observed in some species \cite{girardPolycyclismFundamentalTree2011}. This latter mechanism is also supported by experimental data. Artificial reduction of the leaf area caused terminal buds to keep growing until the original leaf area was re-established \citep{borchertSimulationRhythmicTree1973}. Similarly many species produce new shoots after a damaging spring frost or after severe herbivory in order to rebuild their canopy. \\

This perspective suggests that the environment can completely flip a species' strategy --- but research shows this is not the case. While manipulations on root:shoot ratios have shown a certain plasticity of the apical shoot meristem to adjust leaf area after disturbance, we still observe distinct growth patterns when environmental conditions remain favorable . Hence, there must be an underlying internal program that sets the potential of how trees grow and explains the variation of growth habits among species we observe in the same environmental conditions (see Table XX for a list of species and their main growth strategy). 

%emwJun8 -- really important points to cover below! I wonder how many words you are at? You want to ideally keep perspectives papers at 3-4K words as most journals offer perspectives in that word range (or 2500-3000); I worry once you add all the below points you will be quite long, which is another reason to shorten some of the text above.

	c) these are fundamental trade-offs --- both successful and co -occur in communities
	successional stage, ontogeny, life span, evolution
	
	we should talk also about some downsides of the indeterminate strategy. e.g. faster turnover, increased exposure to risky climate, 
	
	...but will both still be successful with CC?
	
\section*{The role of determinism with climate change}
Climate change is extending the growing season length while at the same time increasing the risk for severe drought \citep{haoChangesSeverityCompound2018} and presumably also late spring frost events in many regions worldwide \citep{zohnerLatespringFrostRisk2020}. How are these potential benefits and threads linked to a species strategy, specifically to the degree of determinism? Which strategy profits most from an extended growing season length and which one is flexible enough to rearrange their phenological cycle to withstand increased environmental stress. And which one comes with more biomass production and C sequestration? We propose that the degree of determinism is an important trait largely controlling the responses of trees in a future climate illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:fig_4xxx}. \\

Spring warming has advanced the onset of leaf emergence by up to a month compared to pre-industrial times \citep{vitasseGreatAccelerationPlant2022b}. In contrast autumn phenology of growth and leaf senescence has not delayed as one could predict from environmental conditions \cite{zaniIncreasedGrowingseasonProductivity2020b, zohnerEffectClimateWarming2023}. In fact, the phenological sequence is observed to shift more as a whole towards spring \cite{keenanTimingAutumnSenescence2015b}, not necessarily leading to increased biomass production during longer growing seasons \citep{zaniIncreasedGrowingseasonProductivity2020b}. We hypothesize that only determinate growing species shift their growth in such a way with minimal changes in overall productivity. In contrast, indeterminate growing species are able to extend their growing period in both directions, leading to an increased productivity in a future climate (Figure \ref{fig:fig_4xxx}). \\

The flexible growth strategies of indeterminate species that help them exploit longer seasons, could also increase their exposure to extreme climatic events. Indeterminate species are often among the first to leaf-out and among the last to shed their leaves (REF) --- occasionally as a result of a freezing event. In addition a substantial part of their growth period falls into summer with increased risk of drought (Figure \ref{fig:fig_4xxx}). Therefore, we hypothesize that the conservative strategy of determinate growing species largely escape from unfavourable growing conditions by placing their growth activities between the last spring frost and the increasing water shortages in summer, with relatively ample safety margins. As a consequence productivity shows little between year variation and will largely remain constant in a future climate. However, once hit by an extreme event, determinate growing species might not recover easily. Even if leaves are shed to prevent further damage, the loss of the canopy, which is rarely replaced in determinate species after summer, will contribute to a lower fitness and reserve pools. In contrast, the flexible growth schedule of indeterminate growing species may allow to 1) produce tissue better adapted to harsh environmental conditions as it is formed in the current season - even if that means no additional growth and 2) catch up and compensate later in the season by another productivity boost. \\

We argue that new opportunities and challenges for trees with climate change will increasingly disrupt their phenological cycle, favoring species who are more plastic in rearranging their activities by resuming growth, reproduction and/or storage filling later in the year, thereby recovering from and compensating for some stress-induced damages and losses. Future climate will therefore likely intensify the competition among co-occurring species and might re-assemble forest communities increasingly composed of species adopting an indeterminate growth strategy.

The responses of these two contrasting growth strategy might apply not only to different tree species but also within a population (e.g. along environmental gradients) and even within an individuum as it transitions from the junvenile to the adult stage (ontogeny).}

\section*{Future directions}
%emwJun8 -- I would rephrase the below to not be questions, but to be how adding determinate strategy to our thinking could help answer these questions. Laying out `questions that remain' this late in a perspective makes readers feel like they have not gained/learned perhaps as much as they have. So instead have more: 

We argue that incorporating plant determinism into our models of forest dynamics could provide better answers to major questions. When and how much is growth and therefore carbon sequestration most impacted by climate extremes and longer growing seasons likely depends on the ratio of indeterminate to determinate species in a forest community. These two strategies, and better understanding them will also help understand the potentials and limits of trees to adapt a future climate.

The fundamental questions regarding the timing and duration of growth remain and are more pressing than ever: When and how much is growth and therefore carbon sequestration most impacted by climate extremes? Moreover, we must question the potentials and limits of trees to adapt --- are they plastic enough to extend their growing period in a climate with prolonged seasons? Or are they bound to follow an internal program in which growth and development occurs within narrow, fixed temporal boundaries? 

\subsection*{Role of determinacy with climate extremes and prolonged growing seasons} %emwJun8 -- consider deleting this sub-header as it builds from previous points, then you can have three subheaders -- Determinacy beyond leaf tissue; Evolution of determinacy; Metrics of determinacy 
The concept of growth determinacy could play an important role in answering these questions and improve our predictions of future tree growth and performance. Specifically, how much degree of (in)determinism allows to escape periods of increased risk of environmental stress while being versatile enough to resume metabolic activities to repair damaged structures, restore reserves and eventually compensate for previous losses during the same season. Assessing the trade-off between buffering extreme events and exploiting a longer growing season will likely contribute to our understanding of how forest communities will assemble over the course of this century.\\

Going forward, we need to identify the plasticity of the trait of exhibiting indeterminate growth under different environmental conditions and the genetic programming of a species and to what extend the latter prioritizes the former. Namely, across species and populations and involving different fields from genomics to physiology and ecology. Moreover, we need to test how universal the concept can be applied/holds true across different meristems and resource allocation. %Lizzie: here I am not sure how to make the thing with resource allocation more clear. To me the strategy of (in)determinism already incorporates the allocation problem, e.g. a determinate species will switch sooner from vegetative growth to reproduction and storage, but perhaps this needs to be stated more clearly somewhere... %emwJun8 -- I think indeterminate species often reproduce earlier in a season than determinate species (but they might also keep producing leaves) so I am not sure we're aligned enough in my thinking to help here. However, I am not sure you need more here... I think you could merge this paragraph with the former and it works pretty well. 

\subsection*{Patterns across meristems} %emwJun8 -- I would either (a) put this section in a separate box or include as a figure with an extended caption. OR, (b) you can shorten it and better connect it... it would fit if you transitioned to it a little better. For example: How much indeterminate growth will impact carbon sequestration in part depends on understanding how universal determinacy is across tissue types. If only leaves show determinate ... 
Although (in)determinate growth is mainly associated with the activity of the shoot apical meristem, a similar pattern or concept might be found in the cambium as well to ensure a timely switch from vegetative growth to reproductive and storage investments. In fact, also cambial cells produce several cohorts of precursor cells with differentiation and lignification being completed at a much later stage only \citep{valdovinos-ayalaSeasonalPatternsIncreases2022}. Hence the number of initial cells divided at the beginning largely determines the amount of total xylem produced \cite{lupiXylemPhenologyWood2010}. In this case, primary growth reflects or at least influences the overall growth performance of an individual, integrated across all above-ground meristems. The low predictive power to estimate the end of wood formation in autumn reported by several studies \cite{buttoComparingCellDynamics2020} indeed points to a mechanism that stem growth in many tree species ceases despite of ongoing favourable conditions and a  green canopy \cite{arendStemGrowthPhenology2024}.\\

Regarding below-ground meristems, roots seem to follow a much more opportunistic strategy with indeterminate growth potentially occuring throughout the year. Warming experiments using Rhizotrones have shown that roots can grow even in mid-winter if temperature allow it \cite{lyfordControlledGrowthForest1966}, suggesting that roots do not enter a state of dormancy \cite{radvilleRootPhenologyChanging2016}. To what extend asyinchrony between above and below-ground meristems occur as a result of different tissue temperatures, root:shoot imbalances or genetically fixed investment strategies remain unresolved\cite{abramoffAreBelowgroundPhenology2015, makotoSynchronousAsynchronousRoot2020}.\\

 Future studies should therefore link the temporal dynamics of primary (apical and root) and secondary (cambial) meristems. Correlating annual tree rings with shoot increments could reveal such a common pattern, if accounting for when interannual shoot segments (phytomers) were produced, e.g. separating preformed from neogrown tissue (REF Günter?). Revealing the patterns of when different meristems are active will likely contribute to a theoretical framework of temporal carbon allocation dynamics.

	bii) Evol. history (end on metric foreshadowing) % @Lizzie: Here I dont know what to do at the moment...happy for some input
	%emwJun8 -- Something like: 
	Understanding how universally tissues within species are determinate or indeterminate could provide insight into the evolution of (in)determinacy, which could be aided by cross-species analyses. Currently, few analyses have examined (in)determinacy occurs across most species in a genera or clade or appears to evolve repeatedly in different groups, making it difficult to speculate on which strategy is ancestral and how rapidly (in)determinacy can evolved. As data on which species are determinate or indeterminate accumulates, such analyses could potentially provide rapid insights into this, and also aid forecasting for unsampled species. Assigning species as determinate or indeterminate, however, may be slow if they trait is actually better considered as continuous. %emwJun8 -- my student Dan B. has lots of papers on this problem (bimodal assignments for continuous traits) for flower-leaf sequences that you could cite, they  have good citations within. 
	
	\subsection*{Metrics of determinacy}
	To address these questions we need better metrics to quantify the degree of determinacy, moving beyond a dichotomous classification system. We propose several metrics from best to acceptable, with increasing spatial scale: \\
	
	(1) The ratio of the number of leaves at the end of the season to the initial number of leaf primordia in buds at the start of the season provides a measure of (in)determinacy. Values above one indicate an increasing degree of indeterminate growth. Although this metric was already described over a century ago by \citet{mooreStudyWinterBuds1909}, its application has been limited to few studies exploring specific regions only \citep{damascosBudCompositionBranching2005, kikuzawaLeafSurvivalWoody1983} \\
	
	(2) Direct measures of shoot elongation (height increments) and/or xylogenesis (micro-cores) at high temporal resolution (e.g. bi-weekly) to assess the temporal dynamics of apical and cambial activity. Especially wood anatomical observations ensure the distinction of cell formation and their subsequent enlargement and development REFS\\
	
	(3) As a proxy for the above, dendrometers provide insights of xylem and phloem formation at high temporal resolution. Although obtained measurements are a mixture of several processes, it allows to identify the tree water deficits and related growth reductions \cite{etzoldNumberGrowthDays2021, zweifelWhyTreesGrow2021}. \\
	
	(4) Using observations of 'second flushes' in large databases (e.g. US national forest network). \\
	
	(5) Patterns and fluctuations of canopy growth detected from drones or satellites using Lidar or spectral techniques. The temporal trend of canopy greenness over the growing season can reveal investment strategies integrated over whole ecosystems and vast areas. As a recent example, \citet{mengConsistentTimeAllocation2024}  found that time allocation between vegetation green-up (from start of the growing season to its peak) and vegetation senescence (between peak and end of season) remained constant despite substantial differences in growing season lengths and degree of warming in temperate ecosystems across the northern hemisphere.

Ontogeny: 
the preformation of leaves inside the seed may be a better strategy than seed mass \citep{silvaCouldPresencePreformed2023}


Deciduous tree species have a higher number of leaf primordia inside their buds than evergreen species in the Cerrado (Brazil). 
	
If experiments are conducted in conditions with unlimited soil moisture and under similar temperature regimes, then the dynamics of growth responses can be comparable among species and reveal their potential in deploying indeterminate growth. Under natural conditions with common soil moisture and associated turgor limitations it is currently hard to tell if trees cease growth because of a response to the environment or because of switches in resource allocation.

	\cite{damascosBudCompositionBranching2005} as a good metric to quantify the degree of determinism and link to the very old reference of first description \cite{mooreStudyWinterBuds1909}

	Shoot growth patterns do not only tell us something about the plant architecture and the strategy of space exploitation, but may reveal also patterns of the whole-plant dynamic and potential of growth and carbon sequestration.
	
	unit of extension vs. unit of morphogenesis: Perhaps state somewhere that we commonly only observe the extension pattern while patterns of organogenesis remain hidden. 
	
	\cite{barthelemyPlantArchitectureDynamic2007}: determinate growth: irreversable transformation of the apical meristem (flowering or other structures, apical death/abscission)
	indeterminate growth: functioning of the apical meristems remains intact (but may have periods of rest)
