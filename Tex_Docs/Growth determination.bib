  abstract = {The architecture and growth pattern of early (Alnus nepalensis and Schima khasiana) and late (Machilus kingii, Quercus dealbata and Q. griffithii) successional tree species in a sub-tropical montane, humid, evergreen forest at Upper Shillong (1900 m) in north-east India were analyzed and related to their ecological strategy for niche occupancy in the forest ecosystem. In the early successional species the architectural development pattern and growth design are geared to maximize production under high light environments. These trees have an indeterminate pattern of shoot growth, a prolonged growth period with greater extension growth and rhythmicity (except for A. nepalensis with continuous growth) and branch mainly by syllepsis. These species emphasize vertical growth at the expense of lateral spread. In contrast, the late successional species make modest growth under a determinate scheme, the growth being confined to preformed bud primordia for a brief period of the growing season. There is less rhythmicity in growth and branch productin is by prolepsis. These species emphasize lateral spread, as an adaptation to highly competitive environments. In forest situations these species have one determinate flush of shoot growth only but in open situations there were two such flushes. Bifurcation ratio values are found to vary in forest and open situations, suggesting the capacity of the species to adjust their architecture to changed light conditions.},

In deciduous trees growing at microsites with low soil moisture storage, phenology and cambium growth are weH correlated with each other and with seasonal rainfall, and most trees have distinct annual rings. Phenology and cambium growth are progressively uncoupled from climatic seasonality in brevideciduous and evergreen trees growing at microsites with large soil water reserves which buffer trees against seasonal drought and thus may prevent the formation of distinct annual rings. There is some experimental evidence conceming the control of growth initiation in apical meristems and the cambium, but little is known about the mechanisms which arrest growth and deterrnine qualitative changes in organ development and cambium cell differentiation.},

Observed growth patterns agree well with those predicted by a model of rhythmic growth which assumes the dependence of shoot growth on the functional equilibrium between shoot and root system. Indirect evidence suggests that cessation of shoot growth under favorable environmental conditions might be a consequence of internal water deficits. Observed differences in shoot growth patterns between young and mature trees are discussed as logical consequences of the model.},

  abstract = {The observed rhythmic growth of trees under relatively uniform environmental conditions has been ascribed by some authors to endogenous factors, by others to slight fluctuations of environmental factors. A model for the simulation of rhythmic growth was developed based on the assumption that endogenous rhythms can result from feedback interaction between two potentially continuous processes, like shoot and root growth, if the slower process is rate limiting for the faster one. Rhythmic growth in trees would be the consequence of feedback mechanisms needed for maintaining a constant shoot: root ratio. Period length of the rhythms depends upon the rates of the growth processes involved. Environmental factors modify period length through affecting growth rates. Growth patterns predicted by the model compare well with growth measurements of tropical trees. The transition from intermittent to continuous growth, as observed under certain conditions, can be simulated by varying a single parameter in the model.},

The terminal resting bud appears only after the rest period; new leaves within the bud are formed only during bud growth and bud break which last 10-14 weeks vs. 2-3 weeks for taxa in the temperate zone. Abscisic acid seems not to be involved in the induction of the rest period.},

The number of shoots regenerated per explant and the number of explants regenerating shoots were then determined after 60 days in culture. Six genotypes were recalcitrant and failed to regenerate shoots. Two genotypes were initially competent for shoot regeneration and consistently regenerated the greatest number of shoots when cultured directly onto shoot inducing medium. Shoot regeneration for the remaining seven genotypes was significantly enhanced by culture on callus-inducing medium for 1--8 days prior to transfer to shoot inducing medium. When internodal explants were cultured on callus-inducing medium for 10 days before transfer to shoot inducing medium, all 15 genotypes failed to regenerate shoots. Regeneration of the nine genotypes that were not recalcitrant was enhanced over the one year period by repeated stock plant hedging. Stock plant hedging was performed by pruning stock plants in such a manner that approximately 4 cm of current stem growth remained. Stock plants were repeatedly hedged at three to four month intervals over the one year experimental period.},

Current life-history theory does not offer a consistent view on the origin of this diversity. We use dynamic optimization to examine resource allocation in seasonal environments, considering that offspring produced at different times of the season have unequal future prospects. Reduction of these prospects during the season produced indeterminate growers that grew mostly after maturation, achieving large final body sizes. It also changed the optimal timing of growth and reproduction during a season, from grow-first-reproduce-later, as usually predicted by life-history theory, to the reproduce-first-grow-later tactic; other tactics were produced by the interactive effects of winter survival and unequal offspring prospects. The results suggest that devaluation of offspring production provides conditions for the evolution of capital breeding, even in fully predictable seasonal environments. Thus, the unequal fate of newborns from different parts of a season may explain the origin of diversity of reproductive phenologies, growth patterns, and capital breeding in nature.},

However, in some plants, the commitment to continued flower production is evidently caused by a plant's commitment to perpetually produce floral stimulus in the leaves. Ultimately, the induction of flowering leads to the specification of flowers at the shoot apex.

The study of trees throughout their entire life span requires retrospective analyses and validates the use of a chronosequence by sequencing observations at different and successive stages. The main axis growth pattern of 62 maritime pines (Pinus pinaster) selected in a chronosequence of three stands consisting of 8-, 22-, and 48-yr-old trees was analyzed retrospectively. Comparison of measured features (length, number of axillary products, reproductive organs) at common ages from the three stands supported the validity of using these data to form a continuous chronosequence. Endogenous trends in tree development are revealed free from variability due to annual growth conditions. Two main phases of development corresponding respectively to the juvenile vegetative and adult reproductive stages were identified, and the transition between both occurred in 9-yr-old trees. The relevance of these two phases and more generally the notion of phase changes are discussed in light of observed trends in the values of studied growth and branching parameters that may either show gradual variations (such as length of annual shoot) or a distinctive expression in one or the other phase (such as presence of female cones).},

  abstract = {The reproductive strategies of plants are highly variable. Short-lived annuals flower abundantly soon after germination, whereas longer-lived perennials postpone and spatially restrict flowering. We used CRISPR/Cas9 and interspecies gene transfer to understand divergence in reproductive patterns between annual and perennial crucifers. We show that in perennial Arabis alpina, flowering in response to winter cold depends on the floral integrator SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15 (SPL15), whose activity is limited to older shoots and branches during cold exposure. In annuals, this regulatory system is conserved, but cold-induced flowering occurs in young shoots, without requirement for SPL15, through the photoperiodic pathway when plants return to warm. By reconstructing the annual response in perennials, we conclude that characteristic patterns of reproduction in annuals and perennials are conferred through variation in dependency on distinct flowering pathways acting in parallel.},

  abstract = {The optimal growth schedule of a deciduous perennial plant is studied theoretically. We make three basic assumptions. First, the daily net photosynthetic rate of a plant increases but saturates with the size of the production part (vegetative organs working for photosynthesis). Second, the production part is discarded at the end of a growing season, but it may be rebuilt at the beginning of the next season using stored material. And finally, the plant maximizes the lifetime reproductive investment by choosing both the growth schedule within each season and the resource allocation between reproduction for the year and storage for the next season. The model is analyzed by the combination of maximum principle and dynamic programming. Our analysis showed three basic results. First, the annual life cycle is optimal under low storage efficiency, low habitat reliability, low growth rate, and a short growing season. Second, under any other conditions, perennial growth is optimal. During years in which the final amount of resources is smaller than a critical value S*, the plant remains immature and saves all of the resources for the next season. If it becomes larger than S*, the plant invests the excess in reproductive activities and repeats the same growth schedule thereafter (steady state). Finally, reproductive effort (the ratio of reproductive investment to total annual production) of a mature plant is high for an annual, is lowest for a perennial just above the threshold for the perennial growth pattern, increases as the length of the season increases, and in a very productive habitat may even exceed the level for an annual. The ratio of the plant size established by stored material to the maximum plant size decreases with the length of the growing season, which quantitatively fits the available data. In light of the model, reported growth patterns and leaf phenology of many deciduous plants indicate that the nonlinearity of photosynthetic rate as a function of the size of the production part is important. For a case with nonlinear photosynthesis but without an upper limit to the leaf expansion rate, a plant's optimal phenology, if normalized by size, can be parameterized by two quantities: productivity (maximum relative growth rate multiplied by a season's length) and stability (annual survival multiplied by storage efficiency). The timing of the cessation of leaf production within a season by a small immature plant is determined by productivity (occurring later in a more productive habitat). Leaf production ends earlier in the season as the plant grows. The optimal time for ending leaf production in a mature plant, in contrast, is controlled mainly by stability (it ceases earlier at a more stable site) and is almost independent of productivity.},

Growth patterns and methods have been shaped by evolution and a great variety of them are observed. Two distinct patterns -- determinate and indeterminate growth -- are of a special interest for these studies since they present qualitatively different outcomes of evolution. We attempt to draw together studies covering growth in plant and animal species across a wide range of phyla focusing primarily on the noted qualitative features. We also review mathematical descriptions of growth, namely empirical growth curves and growth models, and discuss the directions of future research.},

The two species showing the succeeding type emergence pattern have homonomous winter buds characterized by one-lamina and two-stipules sets. The species of intermediate- or flush-type emergence pattern usually have heteronomous winter buds with several bud scales. A negative correlation was found between leaf-emergence duration and number of bud scales. Species having a long leaf-emergence duration were open land or gap invaders. Among them, those having long leaf-fall duration were found in riverside forests. On the other hand, species showing flush-type leaf emergence with short duration and almost simultaneous leaf fall with also short duration were mainly found in mixed-forest stands. The longevities of leaves at the basal part of the shoot were short in the species whose bud scales have not entirely differentiated from foliage leaves. The main evolutionary trend in the shoots was suggested to be from homonomous to heteronomous structure and towards the clear distinction between foliage leaves and bud scales.},

Among the latter, three species were evergreen, one had green leaves in the winter and no leaves in the summer (winter green), and the other had two types of shoots: evergreen and summer green (heteroptosis). In summer-green species of the understory, both leaf emergence and leaf fall lasted only a short time. Duration of leaf emergence was long in open-site species and was intermediate in gap species. Leaf survival can be considered as part of the adaptive strategy of each species. The leaves of understory species emerged in a flush; that pattern could be adaptive to the strongly seasonal illumination of the forest floor. Evergreen and winter-green habits, as well as heteroptosis, were also assumed to be adaptive to life in the understory of deciduous broad-leaved forests, since full sunlight in early spring can be utilized by their overwintering leaves. Leaf survival of gap species was presumed to be more flexible than that of forest understory species. Leaf survival of open-site species was considered to be a strategy to occupy the available open spaces as widely as possible.},

This review will focus on the four-floral inductive pathways which operate in Arabidopsis: Photoperiodic, autonomous, gibberellin promotion, and vernalization pathways and how in this network of pathways, different nodes signify a site of signal integration and how the pathways are integrated, leading to a co-ordinated initiation of flowering.},

To understand how this epigenetic regulation is reverted to allow flowering in the following season, we have forced precocious sprouting of axillary buds in fruit-bearing shoots, and examined the competence to floral inductive signals of old and new leaves derived from them. We have found that CcMADS19 is enriched in repressive H3K27me3 marks in young, but not old leaves, revealing that axillary buds retain a silenced version of the floral repressor that is mitotically transmitted to the newly emerging leaves, which are able to induce flowering. Therefore, we propose that flowering in Citrus is necessarily preceded by vegetative sprouting, so that the competence to respond to floral inductive signals is reset in the new leaves.},

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Fagus sylvatica (Beech) is a large usually single-stemmed deciduous tree native to south-east England but now growing over almost the whole of the British Isles, often planted as a forestry tree on all but the wettest soils. It forms extensive woodlands, where it is dominant over a large altitudinal range, competing primarily with Quercus robur. The outcome of this competition is determined by local soil and climatic conditions leading to a gradation into oak woodlands. It is monoecious, wind-pollinated and notable for its periodic large seed numbers (mast years); seed is dispersed by birds and mammals but mostly drops below the parent tree. Fagus sylvatica is hardy, very shade tolerant, casts a deep shade and is fairly resistant to browsing but susceptible to spring frosts. Due to its shallow rooting and intensive rather than extensive mode of soil water exploitation, it is also susceptible to drought, and this is likely to be the main factor controlling its expected response to climate change. Fagus sylvatica is facing few conservation problems, and indeed, its range is currently expanding into central Europe. However, in the face of climate change, its range is likely to contract from its extremes in all but the north, and Phytophthora diseases may become more serious.},

  abstract = {The development of the trunk and main branches of approximately 26-year-old Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp. et Endl.) Krasser trees was studied. The length and number of leaves of annual shoots were recorded for 56 trees from a natural population. Morphological and macroanatomical features allowed the identification of shoot apex deaths and the axillary positions from which branches and relay shoots derived. The trees had a mean height of approximately 6 m and a mean basal diameter of approximately 8 cm. The length of trunk shoots increased from the first years to the intermediate years of tree growth and decreased for the last 6 years of tree growth. The maximum length and number of leaves of trunk shoots were registered for the years around 1985, when tree age was about 17 years. The likelihood of apex death for trunk shoots was minimum for the period of maximum trunk shoot size. Despite the fact that the architectural features of the sampled trees corresponded to those of young, vigorously growing trees, they seemed to have reached a stage of low annual height growth. A sharp decrease in trunk shoot size occurred in 1992, a year in which rainfall during the growing season reached the minimum for the lifetime of the sampled trees. The size of shoots developed after 1992 was, on average, lower than that of shoots developed before 1992. Stressful conditions in this year may relate to meristem ageing and thus to the size of shoots formed in the following years. Main branches started their development with shoots similar to those of the trunk but were clearly differentiated from the trunk 5 years later. The differentiation between main branch and trunk shoots involved not only a lower shoot size but also a higher number of leaves per shoot length unit in main branch than in trunk shoots.Key words: Nothofagus pumilio, architectural analysis, shoot, trunk development, branching pattern, morphogenetic gradient.},

Each of these phases is characterized by a unique set of morphological and physiological attributes. The intermediate character of the structures produced during phase changes and the phenotypes of mutations that affect this process demonstrate that these phases are specified by independently regulated, overlapping developmental programs. Transitions between phases appear to be initiated by factors extrinsic to the shoot apical meristem; the ability of the shoot to respond to such factors and to remain in a particular phase of development is regulated by factors intrinsic to the meristem. The possibility that developmental phases are maintained by epigenetic cell states and the role of DNA methylation in this process are discussed.},

  abstract = {British woodlands and forests are often located on sites and in regions that are marginal for agriculture; many are at high elevations and exposed, with short growing seasons. Wherever forests are located, site and climatic conditions must dictate species choice in forest management. This book provides a detailed guide to the biological suitability of different sites and soils for all important native trees and the most extensively used exotics. Apart from physical difficulties such as steepness and stoniness, forest soils also frequently have problems associated with them. They can be waterlogged or drought-prone, suffer from extremes of acidity or alkalinity, or have compacted layers. The book provides information on species\&\#39; suitability for different purposes. It includes details of species\&\#39; origin and introduction (where applicable), as well as their climatic and soil requirements and other silvicultural characteristics. Information about provenance, yield and timber is also provided. Fully updated throughout, this 3rd edition puts more emphasis on species suitable for changing climatic conditions, with accounts of several species that may become more prominent in British forests: including several silver firs, hickories, eucalypts, spruces, poplars and wingnuts. The book concludes with simple keys for identifying the trees most likely to be encountered in British forests. It is an essential resource for students, researchers and forestry professionals.},

  abstract = {Nutrient loading of nursery seedling stock of species with an indeterminate growth strategy is challenging and poorly understood. Here, we explore the use of two potential techniques for nutrient loading of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings: (1) exponential fertilization and (2) early shoot growth termination in order to divert assimilated nutrients and carbon to storage rather than to growth. In the first study, aspen seedlings were treated with either exponential or constant fertilization rates, both of which supplied the same amount of nutrients over the growing season. Exponential fertilization resulted in overall poor planting stock form (stunted seedling growth and weak root development) and produced only marginal improvements of nutrient status. As a result, the exponential fertilization regime studied cannot be recommended as a treatment for aspen seedlings. In the second study we treated seedlings with a 2~{\texttimes}~2 factorial combination of fertilization and shoot growth inhibitor (SGI) applications with the fertilizer treatments varying in terms of mid-season fertilizer concentrations. Seedlings with SGI application had much higher tissue nutrient and carbon reserve concentrations than seedlings without a SGI application. In addition, nutrient uptake appeared to be more efficient in SGI treated seedlings, which could potentially result in significant reductions of nutrient application rates during aspen seedling production in nurseries. Overall, early shoot growth termination using a SGI appears to be an effective technique to produce nutrient loaded aspen seedlings.},

  abstract = {Plant phenology is expected to be sensitive to climate warming. In boreal trees, spring flush is primarily temperature driven, whereas height growth cessation and autumn leaf senescence are predominantly controlled by photoperiod. Cuttings of 525 genotypes from the full range of balsam poplar were planted into two common gardens (Vancouver and Indian Head, Canada) at similar latitudes, but with differing winter temperatures and growing seasons. There was clinal variation in spring and, particularly, summer and fall phenology. Bud flush and, despite milder climate, bud set and leaf drop were earlier at Vancouver than at Indian Head by 44, 28 and 7 d, respectively. Although newly flushed growth is insensitive to photoperiod, many genotypes at both sites became competent before the summer solstice. At Vancouver, high-latitude genotypes set dormant terminal buds in mid-spring. Most other genotypes grew until midsummer or set bud temporarily and then experienced a second flush. In both gardens and in a growth chamber experiment, earlier bud set was associated with reduced height growth and higher root/shoot ratios. Shoots attained competency {$\sim$}5 weeks after flushing, which would normally prevent dormancy induction before the solstice, but may be insufficient if spring advances by more than a few weeks.},

  abstract = {The onset of spring growth and vessel formation were examined within three deciduous woody plant species, Acer rubrum, Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa and Quercus rubra. We were broadly interested in the lag between the onset of girth expansion and the formation of mature and hydraulically conductive vessels within the new xylem.Dendrometers were installed on 20 trees (6--7 per species), and expansion of both bole and distal stems was monitored throughout the growing season in a common garden. For each species, four to six distal stems were harvested every other week for anatomical examination of vessel formation. Additionally, for Populus and Quercus, hydraulic conductivity measurements and active xylem staining were completed on all stem samples.For all three species, the timing of girth expansion was similar. Expansion of distal branches occurred 12--37 d earlier than that of the bole. Vessel formation initiated several weeks prior to leaf-out, but no new earlywood vessels were mature at the time of bud break for Acer and Populus and only a few were present in Quercus. Initial stem girth expansion occurred 2 to \&gt;6 weeks before the maturation of the first current-year vessels, and there was an additional delay of up to 4 weeks before mature vessels became hydraulically functional. Hydraulic conductivity was strongly correlated with the number and diameter of stained vessels.Bud break and leaf expansion relied predominantly on water supplied by vessels formed during prior seasons. Early-season activity is likely affected by the function of older xylem vessels and the environmental factors that influence their structure and function. Understanding the functional lifespan of vessels and the varying contributions of new and older vessels to conductivity are critical to understanding of the phenology and vascular function of long-lived woody plants in response to changing climates.},

Annual dry seasons in eastern Amazonia provoke periodical cambial activity which may be measured as variation in girth increment and is recorded in the wood anatomy as well as its density.

  abstract = {Global warming has generally advanced the spring phenology of extratropical trees. In several cases, however, the advancing has levelled off, indicating a declining temperature sensitivity of phenological timing. The po\- tential reasons for the decline have been actively debated, but no direct experimental evidence has been pro\- duced to support any of the theories put forward. With the aid of scenario simulations, we examined which ecophysiological tree traits restrict the advancing of the onset of spring phenology in four subtropical tree species under global warming. In the simulations, we applied process-based tree spring phenology models formulated on the basis of results of experiments specifically designed for examining the ecophysiological responses addressed. We identified three restricting ecophysiological traits: 1) the chilling effect operates at relatively low tempera\- tures only, 2) the temperature sensitivity of spring phenology is low in the temperature range of +10 to +20 {\textopenbullet}C which is critical under climatic warming in subtropical conditions; and 3) the winter rest is deep. Unexpectedly, a high chilling requirement was not included amongst the restricting ecophysiological traits. Our experimentallybased results show that the spring phenology of the trees under climatic warming is significantly affected by seemingly small and usually neglected details of the ecophysiological responses to chilling and forcing temperatures.},
